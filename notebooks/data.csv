0,Changing a Wikipedia article will actually change reality to match what was written. Only the people who edit Wikipedia actually seem to notice this.,"Are you aware of the Mandela effect? The conspiracy theory that when you think something is one way that you remembered, but was something far different? It got its name from the memory people had when Nelson Mandela was thought dead after his activism in Africa, while he was in fact alive and in prison? Maybe you know of it as the Berenstain Bears, where people remembered it as the Berenstein Bears? You can thank Wikipedia of all things for that.It started one day when an editor for a Wikipedia decided to be an internet troll and edit President Donald Trump's page to include a few paragraphs to include his death at the hands of...Sonic the Hedgehog. Someone had warped reality by inserting a fictional blue hedgehog into our world, and gave him the motive to assassinate our president. I would cringe at the idea, but I can't press myself to do so in current circumstances. I'll get to that later.Once someone edited out these events, undoing the death of Trump, more editors started finding that errors such as Mandela's death or the spelling of the Berenstain Bears were making reality shift more and more, and we had to police ourselves more before the public would catch on, if they ever would. That means we couldn't force the death of Hitler before the Holocaust, that we couldn't force the existence of the cure for cancer, these things had to and have to happen naturally or else history and reality will be fractured.Our efforts to keep the world intact while updating and editing Wikipedia have been proven fruitless, however, once user fartbutts420 made their way into the Wikipedia editing community. fartbutts420 was a sociopath, cynical and uncaring to the core, and we are all paying the price. It is due to their edits that our world is blinking out of existence in thirty minutes, and that we are unable to stop it, as prophesized in their article, End of the World. We cannot edit or remove their work, and we cannot write anything to save our world. I'm writing this in the hopes it could somehow, someway, reach someone in another plane of existence to save them. Please, do not misuse Wikipedia."
1,Changing a Wikipedia article will actually change reality to match what was written. Only the people who edit Wikipedia actually seem to notice this.,"I heard the rumours, but the voice of reason in my head knew better. That didn’t, however, stop the temptation to edit a Wikipedia page. It was pretty easy to pick a page. I mean, the US has just experienced of its most peaceful and prosperous year in history. So I thought I could get a good laugh by changing a very obvious and clear fact. It helped that I had been a trusted editor in Wikipedia for a few years. I mean, who else was going to stop the pranksters from editing my school’s page?But I didn’t realise it would lead to this. You, the reader, you won’t believe me. But you’ve got to try. You see, my mess up extended further than a single page. I think that because it was a such a huge change, larger portions of reality changed with it to fit the narrative. How could I have known? I’m just a college student!But it’s too late now. But not too late for you to try spread my story. To warn others of the danger. Please, you have to. I might have deprived the world of a better future, but you can maybe change it if you co-ordinate. You can see my mistake, my horrible mishap [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) . Of course you can see it elsewhere, by that is where it began. And now for at least another three years, that idiot will be smiling back at me on that page."
2,A little girl makes an innocent birthday wish. Suddenly one of every Pokémon appear in our world.,"""So, we gonna do this the easy way, or the hard way?""Two men, both clad in all black and wearing old hockey masks, had me cornered in a dark alley. While this armed robbery surprised me at first, I soon knew exactly what it was that these guys wanted.""Just hand over the damn Pokéball, and we'll leave ya' alone.""Ever since that little girl made her famous birthday wish, people had been trying to get their hands on their own Pokémon in whatever ways they could. I was lucky enough to befriend and catch a Slurpuff on the first day, but not many others had the same fortune.It only took a week before there were reports of the first Pokémon related death, when some guy got shot after refusing to give the Riolu he caught to his ""friend"".And now, I was a victim of another one of these robberies.I slowly placed my hand upon the Pokéball that was fastened to my hip, hovering my index finger over the metal button on the front.""You're not taking Slurpuff away from me.""The two men obviously didn't take this retaliation well. The taller, more muscular man slowly strode behind me, and rested his knife directly underneath my throat. His buddy stood at the entrance to the alley, looking out for any passing pedestrians or cops that might witness the act.""Any last words, kiddo?"" The man behind me asked.As I felt the cold metal blade briefly press against my throat, I slowly pressed the button on my Pokéball.""Yeah. Slurpuff, play rough!""Before the large man could react, Slurpuff jumped at him and started relentlessly punching his face, not letting up until he was lying unconscious on the ground. The second man ran off once his partner hit the ground, dropping his knife and a wallet as he bolted down the street.Once I was sure that the first man was down for the count, I walked over to the wallet and opened it up. The only thing I found inside was a hundred-dollar bill, which I pocketed for future use. The guy definitely wasn't coming back, and even if he did, he probably wouldn't report that some kid he tried to kill took some pocket change from him.After stuffing the money in my pocket, I turned around to see Slurpuff staring at me, the same dopey grin she always had still plastered on her face. After letting her bounce around for a few moments, I pulled the Pokéball off of my belt, held it towards Slurpuff, and pressed the button.""Sorry girl, but it isn't safe for you out here. We'll be home soon though, so don't worry.""After Slurpuff had been contained within her Pokéball, I slowly looked out from the alley, making sure there was nobody suspicious-looking on the street, and began the short walk home. Even though having a Pokémon in this day and age meant that you were wearing a giant target on your back, I still loved my new friend, and knew damn well that I wasn't going to let anything bad happen to her."
3,A little girl makes an innocent birthday wish. Suddenly one of every Pokémon appear in our world.,"""I knew this was a bad idea!""""Just shut up and keep running!"" Jeff shouted back at Mary.The ground shook as the colossal beast slithered closer, gaining speed. Its roar pulsed through the air. A Screech attack. Jeff held his ears closed tight, feeling like they'd begin bleeding any moment.""Why did you have to try and capture it!?"" Mary yelled at him. ""You know that Pokéballs don't work right? This isn't like the games you idiot!""""Well I just thought-""""You thought wrong!""A shadow passed over the two of them, and a boulder landed right ahead. A Rock Throw? Both of them looked back, and silently prayed for their lives.The trees fell apart to reveal the thirty foot tall monstrosity, iron snake Pokémon, Steelix.""Any more bright ideas, Jeff?"" Mary hissed at him.""Just one."" Jeff brought his hand to his mouth, cupped it, then yelled. ""Aria! Use Flamethrower!""The Steelix seemed confused for a moment, until a burst of flame erupted from above. It struck dead center of the Pokémon, and it recoiled in pain. It was part steel so Jeff grinned, knowing it was super effective.A red-feathered bird swooped down, and landed next to its trainer.""Nice to see you Aria."" Jeff grinned to the Talonflame. ""How about we take down this thing together?""Aria nodded in agreement, and flew back into the air, ready for action.Mary almost seemed impressed. ""Nice going, now we just have to hope your bird can actually win.""""Oh, she will. Let's go Aria!"" Jeff cheered to his Pokémon, who responded with a confident cry.The fight had only just begun."
4,A little girl makes an innocent birthday wish. Suddenly one of every Pokémon appear in our world.,"The news had reported it, and everyone was going frantic. Pokemon had started appearing. And with the Pokemon, came Poke-Balls. Six appeared for every person, and people were trying to catch them. The twist was, only one of each Pokemon came. I had to catch one. Just one would be good enough! I had been a fan since I was a kid, and having one of my own would be a dream come true. I took my Pokeballs, and ran outside. I live in a small neighborhood mostly populated by adults, and no kids. I looked around, when I saw it. There was a little Wurmple crawling in the grass. “Yes!” I cheered, and readied my Pokeball. “You’re mine!” The Wurmple turned, and got hit in the side with my Pokeball. The Wurmple was pulled into the ball, and it clunked to the ground. It wiggled once. Then twice. Then a third time. Then no movements. I anxiously waited, when I heard a click. And the Pokeball didn’t move. I was still in shock, before my body decided to respond, and I sprinted towards the Pokeball. “Yes Yes Yes! I caught Wurmple!” I picked it up, held it in the sunlight, and admired it. My first Pokemon. If I were any younger, I would be dead from excitement. “Wurmple, I choose you!” I threw the Pokeball, and in a flash of white light, Wurmple appeared. It looked curiously at its new surroundings, before I bent down to it. “Wurmple, I just caught you. Let’s be friends!” Wurmple smiled, and made a noise of agreement. Then, we heard a little sound in the distance. I saw it in my neighbors tree. I picked up Wurmple, and ran over there. When we got close enough, I saw a Litten in the tree. “Oh, Yes! Wurmple, we have to catch it!” I took out another Pokeball, and got ready to throw. “Pokeball, Go!” I chucked the Pokeball at Litten, and it hit it in the face. Litten was pulled into the ball, and it began shaking. Once. Then twice. Then the ball opened and came back to me. “Ah, it’s not weak enough! Wurmple’s at a disadvantage...” Litten got mad, and used Ember. Wurmple began dodging, but it wasn’t doing a good job. “Ugh, I gotta weaken it somehow....Think.....I’ve got it! Wurmple, use String Shot!” Wurmple shot out a sticky web, which bound up Litten. Litten burned the string, and got ready to attack. “Now use a rapid fire String Shot! Tie it to the tree!” Wurmple began firing webs as fast as it could. Litten could hardly dodge, until two struck it. It began to burn them, but another came, and sent it spinning around a tree branch. Litten was too dizzy to attack. I made my move, and threw my Pokeball. Litten went inside, and it began shaking. Three times it shook, then a click. Two Pokemon! I have two Pokemon now! That’s almost too good. But I didn’t want to stop there. I took Litten out, and I did introductions. “Litten, Wurmple, let’s go find more Pokemon!” I immediately darted towards the lake. I could find at least one water type. Except I didn’t think either of my Pokemon were good at swimming, so I came up with a compromise. “Wurmple, make a net out of your String Shot!” Wurmple began spraying, and made a net. “There we go. Now for bait.” I ran back to the house fast, and grabbed a piece of bread. “Litten, stay back. I don’t think you’d like the water.” Litten was already asleep next to a tree. I put the bait in, set the net down, and waited. It felt like forever that we were waiting. I took the time to pet Wurmple. It seemed to enjoy it. Then, the net got a tug. I ran over, and threw up the net with all my strength. A Psyduck was right in the net waiting for me. “Wurmple, Poison Sting!” Wurmple shot purple poison spines. Psyduck was hit by a few, but it didn’t seem to bother it. It shot a water gun. I told Wurmple to dodge, and it did. But Litten was still in the way, and it got soaked. Litten stood up, got mad, and pounced onto Psyduck, and started clawing its face off. “Woah, that’s some crazy Fury Swipes!” I watched in awe, before Wurmple poked me. “Oh! Right!” I took out my Pokeball, and tossed it. Psyduck went inside, and it began shaking. Just like before, three shakes and it was caught. “Yes! My third Pokemon is Psyduck!” Wurmple jumped up in celebration, while Litten was shivering. I picked up the poor Pokemon in my arms, and carried it back to my house. I got a nice fluffy towel out of the dryer, and helped Litten dry. Litten enjoyed it, and we had a little food in the meantime. The rest of my Pokemon all got acquainted with one another, and I took the time to write their names on the Pokeballs. Seriously, how does anyone tell them apart? After a little rest, we headed out to find more Pokemon. I headed towards the graveyard, hoping to find a ghost-type, my favorite right next to Poison types. We searched around for a while, but no results. When we headed up to the hill, we saw it. A Gengar, just playing in the graves. My favorite Pokemon. I shook from excitement, and sprinted up to it. “Gengar! I have to catch you!”I got Litten ready to go, when I heard a voice. “Not so fast!” I turned around and there was a boy behind me. “That Gengar is mine. I’m going to catch it!”“No way, I was here first!” The boy snickered.“How about we resolve this with a battle? My Pokemon Vs yours? Who ever wins gets Gengar!” He took out a Pokeball. Gengar observed, and seemed to agree with the rules. Alright, an actual battle! I got Wurmple ready to go. “Sounds good. Let’s go! Wurmple, I choose you!” I sent out Wurmple, and the boy laughed. “You have a Wurmple? Pathetic. Go Rowlet!” He sent out Rowlet. Wurmple was at a disadvantage. I could switch out into Litten, but I wanted to save it for later. “Wurmple, Poison Sting!” Wurmple attacked, and Rowlet flew out of the way. “Peck!” Rowlet charged at Wurmple, too fast to dodge. Wurmple flew to the side. “Wurmple! Get up and use String Shot!” Wurmple staggered, but got up, and fired. Rowlet easily cut it up. “Another Peck!” Rowlet charged again. “Hurry and dodge!” Wurmple was too wounded to move, and it got slammed into a tree, and fainted. “Wurmple, no!” The boy laughed again. “Well, I guess I’ll be taking Gengar now.” I readied Litten. “Nuh Uh! I have two more Pokemon!” He stopped in fear. “Y-You do? Which ones?” “A Litten and Psyduck.” The boy started getting afraid. “Uh, you know what, I’ve changed my mind. Bye!” He recalled Rowlet and ran away. I was silent, until Gengar walked up. “Oh, right. I guess he only had Rowlet. Now then....”I’ve had my Pokemon for four months now. And they’ve been so awesome! Wurmple evolved into Cascoon, then Dustox. It would always fly around happily, and scare away birds. Litten evolved into Torracat. She was always very playful, and always napped. She was like the average house cat. I’m still working on how to evolve her into Incineroar. Psyduck only recently evolved into Golduck. He always hung around in the lake and played with the fish.Gengar was just the star of the show. He was always popping into rooms, playing with my family, and doing funny stuff. My little sister especially loved him. My Pokemon made me a huge hit. The news did an interview with me, people would talk to me on the streets, and people at school were jealous. Some people even wanted to do studies on my Pokemon, and I allowed it only if they were very careful. Only a few of them ever really worked out. And then there was the battles. This cute girl at school had a Machoke and Croconaw, and we would battle, and hang out a lot. A boy had an Arbok and Dugtrio, and we became good friends. And every so often I would meet a new person with Pokemon. Except, the battles would get a little tiring sometimes, because the Pokemon would always be the same. But that’s changing. I’m headed to an official Pokemon League, where people who got Pokemon were invited to fight to become Champion. Trainers from around the world are going, and I’m going to meet a lot of new people. My Pokemon have been training for a while for an event like this, and we’re so psyched that it’s finally happening! Wish me luck, and I’ll do my best! Feedback is appreciated! "
5,A little girl makes an innocent birthday wish. Suddenly one of every Pokémon appear in our world.,"Half the city was on fire, and the situation has just moved from horrible to twice as horrible.They watched the dragon for a long time, and saw that there was some sort of  connection with the smaller creature.So they thought that taking down, or capturing, the red one, could stop the orange dragon from destroying the village.But they were wrong, oh how thet were wrong.The brilliant white light vanished as the red beast revealed its new form. The thing just became another Orange dragon, and now the village had to face two of them.-Stop, please, stop- said Lucas, he knew that his voice was too low, and not only the creature could not hear him, but there was no chance it could understand.But he was desperate, he always had been the leader of the village since the day the creatures arrived. But it looked like their time was up, as the two dragons, raging as loudly as ever, were about to destroy the village.Most of the houses were on fire, some of its inhabitants were dead, and there was nothing he could do. His little friend, the trembling creature, for the first time was not trembling, and was holding the leg of Lucas the same way it usually held on the shining cerulean blanket over his body.-Don't be afraid little friend Snorunt- said Lucas. -For we have done everything we could for humanity. And this is our final moment, and we can leave with our head held high.The two dragons smelled the fear from everyone, and, as beast do, felt as a menace the only two unafraid creatures. Lucas and his friend.So they slowly approached them, moving the four paws the same way a cat does while approaching his prey.-DO IT BEASTS. I KNOW I CAN DO NOTHING. BUT I WILL NOT SCREAM WHEN YOUR FIRE TOUCHES ME.The two dragons got up on their two strongest paws.The little friend, Snorunt, let go Lucas leg, and moved in front of him, then opened up his little arms to protect its friend.But when the flame left the throat of the two dragons, no inhabitant of the village could do anything; and that's why when the two did not die, nobody could understand what happened.Lucas could see, just for a second, a pink shield in front of him, disappearing as a little sounds, similiar to a meow, came from the sky.Up there, above their head, a little pink creature flew above the two dragons.The two dragons seemed terrified, as if that little thing was the biggest threat of their lives. After a few seconds, the dragons flew away.And a little girl, running, reached the village.And after her, a giant green bug, a brown bull, an enormous kangaroo, and all sorts of creature approached the village.-I'm so sorry- said the girl.Lucas was confused, but the creature clearly meant no harm, sofelt the urge to hug the little girlThe girl hugged him back. And started crying.-Thank you- Said Lucas.-You don't have to thank me. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It was just a wish... now i have to catch em all..."
6,A little girl makes an innocent birthday wish. Suddenly one of every Pokémon appear in our world.,"""Papa, I'm really sleepy.""""Sleepy? Alright then. I suppose we'll have to make due here."" The father looked around the dead forest for a few moments before setting down his rifle and backpack against a nearby tree. His daughter did the same.""Can we build a fire this time papa? I'm so cold.""""No, I'm afraid not dear. The smoke will lead them to us.""""Who? The bandits?""""Yes.""""Or the monsters?""""Them too."" The father took out a lightweight sleeping bag roll from his backpack and handed it to his daughter.""What kind of monsters are around this forest papa?"" The daughter unfurled her sleeping bag across the ground, disrupting the dead leaves and ashes.""I don't know. When they first appeared they all managed to appear in their...natural habitat, I guess you could say. Bugs and plant-based ones probably would have inhabited a forest like this. But when the big ones started to attack and we attacked back, well, that's how we all ended up like this. And now they roam around too, just like us.""""Do the big ones roam around the world too?"" She was now tucked into her sleeping bag staring at her father with the same blue eyes her mother had.""Some of the ones that survived, yes. At least one of them went into space.""""One of them went into space?"" The daughter's eyes widened in shock. ""Whoa, how do you know that?""""I saw it myself.""""You saw it yourself!?  What did it look like?""""Well, it was a big, long, green snake flying up in the sky, just beneath the gray clouds.""""Wow."" The father began to laugh. ""Papa why are you laughing?""""I was with your mom when I saw that monster. She said the same thing. 'Wow.' She said the exact same thing.""""What did you say?""""A few words that you're too young to be using.""""What did you do?""""We were too in shock on what to do. We just froze. Stayed as quiet as can be. It passed by us and kept on going, and then suddenly, about a half mile out, it screamed and rushed up. Sent a shockwave out that nearly destroyed the house we were inside of at the time.""""Wow. That sounds so crazy. And scary.""""It was crazy. And it definitely was scary too. When we looked outside where it had been all we saw was the ash that it had kicked up, and a faint light coming from a big hole in those clouds.""""A hole in the clouds? Did it scare some of the clouds away?""The father laughed. 'Yes it did. And your mother and I were so curious that we just had to run out and see what was past those clouds.""""You ran out there? After that crazy monster?""""We did. We ran as fast as we could to catch a look. To see something that we had never seen before in our lives. Something that our parents and grandparents never saw in their lives.""""And what did you see?""""A long tunnel of dark clouds. And at the end was seven sparking stars in the darkness. A darkness unlike any we had ever seen. It was frightening and yet so very, very beautiful.""""I wish I could have seen that.""""So do I. Maybe one day you will. But for now, it's time to sleep.""""Okay papa. Good night."" The daughter turned over and closed her eyes.""Good night dear.""""If I ever want to see the stars I might need to meet one of those monsters to scare the clouds away for me though.""""...I really hope you don't."" The father stared at his daughter until she fell asleep. He picked up his rifle and hugged it against his chest as he closed his eyes. ""I really hope you don't."""
7,A little girl makes an innocent birthday wish. Suddenly one of every Pokémon appear in our world.,"When she left, I was brought here on my own journey. Seeking what, I am not sure. If it is a stone, or a mossy rock, or an icy boulder, I will find it — I will find her. She left me here for a reason. I need to discover how I evolve. "
8,"In a world where Elves, Dwarwes, Humans and other being live, you're a unique being. A sentient, highly magical fungus.","&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmmm~I love this time of the year. It's so nice to be able to spread your mycelium all over the ground while eating the fallen leaves. Not like in the summer when everything is so alive and resisting. I prefer having free food. It's been so good lately that I've even been getting mushrooms! It feels so good when something touches it. Just having the wind come by and..Aaaaaah~The wind is being so generous today. Please wind, please give me more! Yes! Yes that's it! Just keep going like that! Yeeeeeeeeees~Life is truly good here in the forest. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The dwarf approached the fence first, followed by an entourage of other humanoids. Some big, some small, some looking like they don't want to be there but most looking around and taking pictures on their Stasis Projection orbs, SPorbs for short. They all formed a half circle around the dwarf, looking at and over him as the harsh winds blew over their faces. ""And this 'ere is the source of all the wind in Ventus Forest. It's called the Amanita Ventana. It's a magic mushroom that keeps itself high. Heh heh heh..""The silence continued as the crowd either looked at him in confusion or was struck silent by the awful joke.Seeing this reaction, he switched over to a monotone voice as if he started reciting: ""The Amanita Ventana is one of the few rare magic funghi that exist on Astera. It creates these winds using magic to help it spread its spores. The characteristic blue glow is a result of the magic stored inside it. It is thought to have self awareness, but since sentient mushrooms are so rare, nobody knows how it expresses itself let alone communicate.""An amalgamation of ooohs and aaahs erupts from the crowd, with the occasional curious hmmm. The SPorbs start flashing like usual and the group moves on to the next attraction. In one last attempt the dwarf says: ""Ya might never know, perhaps it's trying to talk to us, but it might as well be jacking off. We'll never know! Whahahaha..""Once again the crowd stayed silent."
9,"In a world where Elves, Dwarwes, Humans and other being live, you're a unique being. A sentient, highly magical fungus.","The distant humming awoke me from my slumber, the memories of the surrounding  land infusing themselves into me as I sprang from the ground.My hands pierced the hard packed dirt, clasping themselves firmly together as my sinuous body corkscrewed itself out of the ground. A churning whirlwind of dust and decayed matter accompanied my exit from the warm embrace of the earth.I will miss that embrace, I thought, as I pulled myself from the ground. Shaking the last remnants of debris off, I looked down to check my body.The fibers of my being shined with the moonlight, a slow and pulsing green of noxious earthen energy. It was volatile and begging to be released, surging through my arms and ascending the dust around my feet. The small whirlwind coated the fibers in a layer of hard clay armor.“Now where am I?” I asked aloud to the barren land. Placing my hand to the ground, a focused wave of encroaching energy was spread out to assess information from the local flora. The feeling was exhilarating every time, it never got old. The amount of information I was able to access at a moments notice. It made the job easy for sure.The green wave of energy rushed back to my fingertips like a frightened fox, the coalesced energy on my fingertips seemingly excited to return with its bounty. I swallow the information, literally, ingesting information the way a mushroom knows how.The taste of blood, of mixed origins. Humans...their distinct cosmetics and overbearing hygiene overpowering the normally bland taste of their blood. “The animals.” I declared with a smug disinterest, waving away their pestilent thought with a caress of my jaw. Is that...dwarven blood? The diminutive sub-humans never left their subterranean homes, much less their mines and mountains. What was the blood of one doing here?Old War and magic were the lasting aftertaste of the energy. The fibers of my calves tensed in reflex at the overbearing realization. A quick scan of the land in front of me revealed a small oasis. A small patch of flourishing forest thrived in this large and barren tundra. A quick shuffle of memory accessed information that this land was always a tundra. An anomaly sat under the oasis, the source of its continued survival.An elf woman buried with a congealed magic crystal, encased in a dwarven coffin of the finest make the funneling the crystals energy into the oasis.I sigh at my duties. As much as I love to see life flourish, my existence was to preserve the natural balance. This magic...making this land flourish was not natural.“Focus. One day I will return the life that I have smothered this day.” I said to myself and as a promise to the budding oasis.Palms to the ground, the energy within shifted from its vibrant and slow green to the rich browns of earth, a landslide hurtling towards the oasis.The scene never got less exhilarating, yet it carved a wound just as deep every time. “Excuse my wound mother, I will heal it in time.” I say, kneeling to the ground. A single tear streamed down my fibrous face.It consumed the oasis in a hurried rush of decay. The trees ran their entire lifetime in a moments notice, leaves and seeds falling and shriveling to dust on the way to the ground, wiping their existence away. The small birds and insects simply ceased being, mere shells of themselves before being carried away by the tide of energy. The small pond within was the last to part, it’s waters filled with a high concentration of magic.The swirling wave decay rose high above the small mass of water, a colossal python of decaying energy set to strike upon the depths of the waters at the crystal.It plunged.The water was a hard defense, a shifting mass of solid, transparent material. Durable enough to stand war machines and high concentrations of mages working together.“Mother, lend me your strength.” I asked absently, setting loose a focused stream of vibrant green energy among the tides, it coming to a rest as it shone inside the head of the decaying energy.The head plunged into the waters as it dig into the funnel, snuffing out the crystals energy and causing the dwarven coffin to rust into nothing more than a few bolts and a sturdy frame.“These dwarves are getting more meticulous with their crafts. Soon, I suspect none can stop them.” I said with a hearty laugh as I willed the tides of energy back to me.It rushed back to my body like a salmon to the breeding grounds. The head of the brown energy struck my hand and I winced as I relived the death of every single organism with that oasis.A sigh of relief. “Sometimes I hate my job.” I say, sitting back down on the hard dirt I sprouted from.Where the oasis once was, stood a patch of green grass no more than a foot high.I smiled in content. “At least I have command over my power, these humans and elves let theirs run rampant. The imbeciles, if they only knew how to ask for help.” I laughed as I struck the ground with a closed fist.The ground swallowed me once again, as I lay in wait for the next anomaly upon the land to spring up. "
10,"In a world where Elves, Dwarwes, Humans and other being live, you're a unique being. A sentient, highly magical fungus.","The moving creatures have been at war for 100 sun cycles, but they all seem to be fighting for similar reasons. The creatures with the pointy things on the sides of their heads say they were here first. But the small creatures with the beards say their ore mines pre-date any civilization.  The third group of creatures is a curious one. They look like a mixture of the other two groups. But they don’t care who arrived first.  All they care about is power and conquest. Or so we thought. Symbiosis is the nature of the universe. Relationships between lifeforms can form the foundation that holds ecosystems together or create the mayhem that tears them apart. Millions of sun cycles ago, our planet exploded, sending pieces of molten rock cascading across the galaxy. While the destruction of our home forced millions of lifeforms into extinction, it also created the potential for intergalactic travel. Our species survived tucked away in the deep holes of our planet’s crust. The large pieces of rock sent flying acted as our vessels, and we landed with a furious crash upon where we now reside. Like our planet’s destruction, our arrival also forced more lifeforms into extinction. Our vessels penetrated into the planet’s skin, sending clouds of dust and ash into the air. The sun was blocked for what felt like millennia. Everything that breathed oxygen or needed the sun to survive died. But life is resilient.It took millions of sun cycles for the toughest life forms to begin their evolution. From bacteria to amoeba and beyond, our species has witnessed the death and growth of life on this planet. Our spores and family have spread across every region, touching every ecosystem. We use each other to communicate, to feel vibrations, and to influence our environment positively.  We can see everything. We know everything. And it is time for the moving creatures to stop fighting.  Consciousness is a confusing power. The moving creatures, with all their aspirations and technology, have forgotten their origins. They have forgotten that their histories are inexplicably linked. They must be re-wired. And the only way to do that is from the inside. We always grew and existed in the shadows. The dark, moist sections of the earth — our sanctuaries. But now, we needed to reveal ourselves and integrate our understanding into the collective consciousness. We sent out spores to grow on sticks floating down streams. We attached ourselves to leaves ready to be carried away by the wind. We spread across the planet, each year becoming more visible and enticing to the moving creatures. Then we were eaten. The group that looked like a mixture of the short ones and the ones with pointy ears, were the first to consume our kind. Their shamans and explorers harvested our bodies and brought back large quantities of our flesh to use in their special ceremonies. Slowly, more and more of their kind consumed our kind. And their motivations began to change. Our composition means even being consumed is an act of symbiosis. The moving creatures receive sustenance and stimulation, we receive a new host to call home. Once digested, we begin to integrate with the brains of our new hosts. And slowly over time, we can change the way an entire species thinks. The moving creatures gained access to our understanding of the planet, and we gained access to the collective consciousness and power of the moving creatures. With that. a new age of humanity dawned. With our new symbiotic understanding, we now could classify the moving creatures. The humans, as they call themselves, have set out to mend the rifts between what they call, “Elves” and “Dwarves.” Conquest is no longer their objective, but to learn the origins of their species through the understanding of two much older civilizations. Little do they know, they have more common with the Elves and Dwarves than they could ever imagine. "
11,"You are a superhero that wields the power of plot twist. You always somehow manage to save the day with unexpected events when you are about to lose. One day, you have met your match; a supervillain that wields the power of plot holes.","Rain gathered and buildings crashed, dust billowed and a gust of wind carried it through the city--two figures stood apart beneath the cloudy grey city skyline. The caped man stumbled, and fell back--reaching toward the dull sky.A young woman--possibly a teen--stepped closer to him, the look of utter satisfaction spread across her perfect perfect lips and glistening marble skin. She smiled, and two long and pointy fangs were bore.  ""It is  like over,"" She said. ""This is like, totally no longer your city.""The man's eyes lost their spirit, and he could hardly move. Drops of rain hit his forehead. He just stared up at the sky--and he saw hope. ""I don't think so."" He said, and the drops rain began to lessen.The teen approached him and leaned over. ""You've lost, just like--accept it.""""I can't accept a world where people like you think you can rule."" He scoffed, and a little but of blood dribbled out from the side of his mouth. ""I can barely life a finger, but for your sake, I think I'll manage this...""The man began to weakly raise his hand, and pointed his finger to the sky. The girl looked up, and through the clouds a beam of light peered through and illuminated the young teen's face.  She looked down after taking in the ray--""So?"" she said.The man's eyes widened, ""But I thought sunlight was you--"" His mouth was grabbed and she begun to lift him from the ground with her perfectly manicured hands. Her luscious and utterly voluminous hair glistened perfectly in the light.In the moment he was being lifted--the man realized something was near--a piece of a wooden chair leg that was broken in a way to give it a point. The man didn't question his luck--and grabbed it. With all his strength he shoved it deep into the girl's heart. Like wings of blood--spraying out from her back, splattering into the air and ground with a raging force.  She smiled, ""That won't work on me anymore."" She said, tossing the man, his divine luck and efforts aside with a hand wave--he collided into a pile of rubble. ""I am like, so much stronger than you think. I am the hero this world needs, just move aside old man.""""No."" He said. ""Rude."" she said. ""Like, whatever. I'll let you be ungrateful. It is a new era.""""No."" He said. ""You think everyone will fall for you and be alright with you, don't you? Because you think you are perfect all the time."" ""I am just your average teen-hero-vampire."" She said, and flicked her hair. ""And you are so old news. I've beat you, you lost. Give up.""The man couldn't move anymore--he could feel the rebar sticking through his side. ""I'll admit I've lost. I'm pretty weak compared to a lot of people, and I know that. But I always try my best and to do what is right. Here is a thing you might have never heard before in your perfect fantasy life--it is okay to lose. It happens.""""You don't need to say anymore, I've heard enough of old people thinking they like know anything."" She said, and turned her back on him. ""I've kicked your butt, and I've won today.""He closed his eyes. ""You think you've won today... Heh. Think like that if you want. I'm not giving up.""""Fight me, go ahead. I'll beat you down every time you come at me.""""Plot twist,"" He said with a smile realizing something-- he clutched his side and stemming the flow of blood that was beginning to form a  thick puddle around him. ""I'm not going to fight you like you want. I see now you're just a kid. Even if it is the last thing I do, I will make you see how the adult world really is.""""Shut up."" She said. ""You can't hide in your perfect little world forever. You'll grow up one--""""Shut up!"" She was as quick as the fastest superhero out there--maybe faster. ""Shut up!"" She was right upon the man--raising her hand up and bringing it down upon his chest. Blood splattered, and bones crunched beneath her blow.Blood soaked her hand, and she breathed out. ""I'm the hero. There is no place in the world for you, old--..."" Something moved, and the girl spotted a small crowd of people hiding among the destroyed havoc of the city. They looked on with horror at what she had done.She looked down at the man, limp and lifeless. ""Old man... I'm the hero.""There was a child in the crowd, and tears began to well in their eyes, dropping a doll of caped man.She stood tall, and she could see the crowd cower and gasp at her movement. Looking at her bloodied hand. ""I'm the hero... Right?"""

13,An ancient sword containing the spirit of it's original master accidentally gets included in a batch of scrap metal being smelted to build a mighty warship. When all seems lost in a desperate sea battle the spirit decides it is time for it to actively defend the crew it became protective of.,"I, who was once, am and yet am not.Some think immortality a curse. Some think it a gift. I think it useful.Once, I was human. I forged the greatest swords ever known, and those blades brought the god-king to his knees, where we saw him to be only human. As reward, our new king bound me to his own sword, the greatest of my works. And there I lay, content to watch history being forged. My hilt felt many hands, some just and some unjust. If I thought them unworthy, I repelled them. For a time, I was a legend. But legends fade, and turn to myths, and myths to wisps of stories. So I rested over a fireplace for many, many years, my name forgotten and my king millennia dead. I did not resist when thieves stormed the house and yanked me away; I knew they would not use me. The strange balls of metal had taken the place of swords for so many. They pondered my value, and thought it nothing. So they traded me away, to a rubbish blacksmith who thought me cheap metal, and reforged me. Memories of the heat still linger. But when he was done, I had something of a body -- crude, to be sure, and clearly made of a man's fantasy. It seemed strange until he affixed me to the helm of a ship. A magician blessed the ship, and they christened me 'Windbearer'.My crew were not virtuous, but they were good. Most were given to rum, but all were kind, and all had their own kind of morals. The first time they ran down a slaver's ship, I thought my metal heart might burst from my chest. But the wind batters me now, aided by the furious blows of cannonballs. I can feel the cabin boy's life blood soaking into the ship's planks, he who ran from a broken family and found hope here. The captain, who told me stories about his wife when he could not sleep, lies too still. *Something must be done.*So for the first time, I open my eyes, and rise. Pirates they may be, but they are *my* pirates, and I will wash away all the Grand Navy before I let them die.One of mine sees my hands raise and turns from his cannon in time to see the nearest ship go under, overwhelmed by mighty waves. ""Windbearer?"" he breathes, followed by a, ""Gods, is it?"" ""It is."" "

Instead, your soul shall know no rest as it is trapped forever in this blade."" Cenric knelt before his enemy, defeated completely. Blood seeping from his many wounds, but his deepest pain was knowing that his rebellion failed. It was all for naught, and his people were going to suffer for it. Cenric barely felt the blade enter his chest, and soon he felt nothing more.Slight consciousness survived as Cenric recognized his prison over time, but it was many centuries before he became truly aware again. By then, his rebellion was nothing but history. So Cenric sat and he watched as everything passed him by.On its twelfth tour, the Cenric was a battle hardened warship. But unfortunately all ships become decommissioned at some time. Even more unfortunately for the crew, it looked like that time was coming quickly, and at the expense of their lives. The ship was currently surrounded by several German U-Boats, and was being pelted by bullets from every angle. The sounds were deafening as the soldiers ran around trying to return fire.It was to this noise that the spirit of Cenric awoke to once more. It has been several years since his spirit was released from his prison and he was free to wander at least a little further. However, he must always remain close to that which bound him, which was now a part of this ship, aptly named after him. It didn't take long to assess the situation, having been awakened by many other firefights, Cenric was used to how battle was done now days. This also meant that Cenric was aware of how screwed the crew was. Already, men were dropping like flies as holes sprung up all over their bodies. It was a complete slaughter, it only needed to play out.Cenric was the first to notice it, but one of the crew began shouting quickly after. ""TORPEDOES!"" The ship was going to be sunk, and rather quickly by the looks of it. It only took moments for Cenric to realize that if the ship went down, than so too would he be spending eternity at the bottom of the ocean. He learned a couple of tricks in spirithood, but this would take all of his effort. Cenric quickly dove into the torpedo heading straight for the ship. Expanding everything he could, he pushed the torpedo down as hard as he could, causing it to miss by a mere inch. Then Cenric immediately began pulling it up, steering it right at a different U-Boat. It hit its mark, or rather it hit the completely wrong mark. The explosion opened a large hole in the hull of the ship, dooming it to a watery grave.Preoccupied with imminent sinking, one of the ships began letting up on the fire. This became quickly apparent to the Cenric's captain, and soon after, quickly exploited. The Cenric made its way rapidly towards the new hole in the enemy's ambush and all focus was in getting the ship through it. If they could make it another ten leagues, the ship could reach safe water. It was a big ""if"" but it was their only chance. The ship started heading full power towards the opening, somehow hitting acceleration it never previously seemed to be able to reach. Miracle after miracle occurred; two torpedoes were launched and two torpedoes missed, no more came. Bullets seemed to fly past the soldiers' heads, but no longer seemed to connect. The U-Boats were quickly falling behind, and the raid on the ship lessened with each passing moment. The captain took some time to thank God for His intervention, for who else could have done such a thing.Cenric sat on the deck, exhausted if a spirit could feel that. It felt like his weight returned to him, and tripled. Interacting with so many physical objects took a toll on him, but he was able to save the ship. The crews of the U-Boats were now most likely examining their engines in wonder. Even their torpedoes would no longer fire. It didn't take long for the U-Boats to disappear in the distance. Cenric smiled, maybe he was still a little bit useful in this world, but for now it was a time for rest. "

When all seems lost in a desperate sea battle the spirit decides it is time for it to actively defend the crew it became protective of.,"# 1199 - JapanMinamoto no Yoritomo knelt at the base of the great tower, dressed entirely in white silk. He was completely still, and heavy chains bound him to iron loops buried deep in the surrounding earth.The magistrate stood over Minamoto and addressed the crowd. ""Kare wa nan sen-ri mo koroshita. Kare wa sono tochi ni mijimedesu. Kare no hanzai no tame ni, kare wa fūin sa rerudeshou!""The crowd loosed a bloodthirsty wail. The magistrate waved them to silence and only when there was no sound whatsoever did he gesture to the executioner. Four men approached garbed in dark robes, bearing incense. A fifth man, all in red, carried a katana housed in an intricate wooden box. Minamoto watched them impassively, his face an unreadable mask. The man in red stopped in front of Minamoto. With great sweeping movements he removed the Katana from its wooden box and gracefully held it in two hands. Without a word he pivoted toward the new Shogun sitting in his throne and kneeled. Ten thousand people waited in abject silence, all eyes on the Shogun. Finally, the Shogun stood, looked pointedly at the man in red, and nodded. ""Hai."" The man in red stood up swiftly, spun around and poised the sword blade over Minamoto's heart. It hung there completely still. Minamoto did not blink. Another long pause during which only the incantations of the dark robed figures could be heard. The man in red eventually spoke. ""Hanasu. Matawa shizuka ni shinu.""Again all eyes shifted, now to Minamoto, facing a fate worse than death. Would he break? Would he beg? Slowly, half a millimeter at a time, the mask of Minamoto's inscrutable face morphed and transformed, until the impassive line of his lips was upturned and the cold, hard stare of his eyes were thinned in a smile. Then he laughed. He laughed brazenly and without a hint of anxiety. He guffawed with such gusto that some of the audience left in fear. All that looked upon him wondered at his insane courage. Even the bearer of the sword wavered almost imperceptively. At last, after the hearty and full bodied laughing was done, his face returned to a passive, stony mask, free of all human feeling, and Minamoto spoke. ""Anata no orokana ken de watashi o utte kudasai. Kore wa jikan ga kakari sugimasu, hiza ga itaidesu.""The man in red obliged him.# 2010> The USS Washington Carver was christened today. The most modern warship in the NATO arsenal and made entirely of non-virgin steel, the Carver consists in part of token metals taken from the culture of each NATO nation. Most famously the executioners sword of Minamoto no Yoritomo is embedded permanently into the steel of the bridge. The Prime Minister of Japan was present today for the christening, declaring that the ship would add to the fight for global peace and saying Japan was proud to include the ancient sword as a powerful symbolic gesture of the country's indominatable will. # 2019 - South China Sea""Incoming!""The boson's warning was overwhelmed by the crack of a shell cutting through a sattelite dish and landing in the water astern with a deafening explosion. Waves from the impact rocked the ship violently and several sailors fell from the decks into the roiling sea. On the bridge Captain Harris stared straight ahead, toward the north, into the growing storm. The engine was set to full forward, 30 knots into the depths of the violent squall. In the distance the Captain could see churning waves. Experience told him they would be taller than the ship itself. But there was no choice. Behind them two destroyers were in close pursuit, firing with their forward guns as they too bobbed in the tumultuous waves. They came from no where in the night and fired their guns to kill. Several impacts on the upper hull, but no critical damage. ""Death on all sides."" Captain Harris murmured to himself. In the chaos his officers did not hear, but they all saw his face and knew well enough what awaited them. Another shell buzzed toward the ship and landed in the crest of a large wave. Deep beneath the water it exploded, shooting a spray of ice cold salt water 50 meters into the air.Their pursuers understood the Carver's limitations well and followed just outside the effective range of her rear guns, but well within the range of their own forward cannons. Captain Harris steeled himself. The only chance was to evade the enemy in the storm, whatever the danger. ""Forward, come what may.""Just then another call came over the radio. ""Enemy ahead!"" The Captain and his officers ran to the front windows of the bridge and peered into the stormy distance. They saw it out there, one enemy cruiser, somehow, beyond all probability, coming at them through the storm. A pincer manuever. Trapped.All hope faded out of the bridge and each man looked one from the other and, ultimately, at the captain. The Captain knew surrender was not an option, the enemy would take no quarter. Nor could they hope to be victorious in a sea battle. But, in the end, there was no choice to make. ""Reverse course, bring us broadside to the southerly ships and prepare to bombard.""The order went out and not a sailor on board doubted that death awaited them. But they would make it a costly death. Slowly the ship turned to the east, its main cannons twisting in the sea spray toward the overwhelming enemy. It began in the engine room. A whisper heard only by an ensign assigned to janitorial work. The young man sat huddled and useless beneath the primary turbine, waiting for a shell to breach the hull and let in the freezing ocean to claim him. > ""Ima wa sore ga watashi no tatakaidesu.""The ensign looked around for the source of the sound, but saw nothing. Standing alone beside the gargantuan turbine he said ""Hello?""> ""Mite kodomo.""A roar began to emanate from the turbine, and a bright blue glow filled the cavernous engine room. The ensign shielded his eyes and tried to report over the radio, but it no longer functioned.On the gun deck the gunmen prepared to fire. The ship was just about lined up with the southeastern enemy ship. The order to fire was about to be given when a distant flash was seen from across the sea. ""Incoming!""The shell flew through the air with a whir, aimed dead center amidship. It should have impacted the Carver mid hull and split her in half. It was the perfect shot. But instead the shell impacted 100 meters from the ship, in mid air. There was a blue flash and then an explosion. The engines tripled in power at the same time and the USS Washington Carver moved speedily of its own accord. The Captain went to his radio with concern. ""Report? What's happening down there?"" But instead of an engineer responding a powerful voice came over every radio on the ship.> ""Anata wa kyō meiyo o motte kōdō shimashita. Anata no hōshū o mite kudasai!""The guns began to glow bright blue as the cruiser sped through the water like a speed boat. Enemy shells flew in as the enemy ships turned broadside and unleashed withering volleys of artillery. But every shell exploded uselessly against the invisible blue shield.The entire crew watched, mouths agape, as the ship wreaked Poseiden like havoc on the open sea. It went for the south eastern ship first, blasting it with shells from the main guns, each shell glowing a deadly blue as they flew across the sea through the chaos of water and wind. They impacted dead center on the enemy ship and exploded in a mushroom cloud melange of conventional gunpowder and arcs of blue energy. Every man on board the Carver burst into a cheer. Each radio echoed the ship's yell.> ""Shinu!""With whip like speed the ship turned to face the westerly ship. Another blue tinged volley reached out and evaporated the enemy.Meanwhile the cruiser coming from inside the storm, seeing the insane power unleashed on its compatriots begun to spin around, back into the mealstrom. The Carver made chase, racing out into the churning sea until it was right beside the enemy cruiser, all the while blocking incoming fire from their rear guns. As the raging ocean plunged each ship up and down, over many dozens of meters, the Carver itself, the voice of the ship, spoke over the main loud speaker forbthe enemy sailors to hear. > ""Ima anata wa okubyōmonodesu. Anata wa okubyōmono no shi de shinudeshou!""From the aft of the ship a laser like beam of blue energy appeared and, in a half second, sliced lengthwise across the enemy. For a few moments nothing appeared to happen. But when a large wave came, the entire enemy ship split in half horuzontally along its length.  The enemy sailors could be seen screaming, clutching at handrails and falling into the sea, along with the entire top half of their ship.In the aftermath, the Carver brought itself quickly out of the storm and into calm seas. When all was silent the Captain made inquiry in the radio. Not sure what to ask, he said simply. ""Who are you?""> ""Watashi wa anata no hito ga nani o itte iru no ka wakarimasendeshita. Anata wa umaku tatakau node, watashi wa anata o watashi no norikumiin to shite tamotte imasu.""The captain had no idea what this meant. But he was damned thankful to be alive. ""Well... thanks."" He said and ordered his men to gently guide the Carver to port.## For More Stories# r/LFTMEdit: introduction added along with some other detailsI purposely left the japanese untranslated as I think it's both uncessary to understand the exact story but also fun, if you're into that sort of thing, to just run it through google translate.

When all seems lost in a desperate sea battle the spirit decides it is time for it to actively defend the crew it became protective of.,"“When you take care of your weapon, it will take care of you.  Remember that, my child.  It is a part of you.”…It’s the little things that build up to things.  Big things, events; big realizations, ideas.  It always starts somewhere small, and grows and grows with other small things, noticeable or not, dismissed or called out.I remember when I first got my blade.It’s a strange thing for a being that has no mind to remember things with.  But I was different then; a different form, a different person.  Young, naive.Children like me weren’t supposed to get a blade.  We didn’t fight, we didn’t scuffle.I wanted to.  I wanted to be the hero that I heard of in legends; I wanted to be that name whispered on the wind.  My father didn’t mind.  He loved my smile, he loved my excitement.  He told me more stories, showed me the shapes in the stars at night when the embers of his forge glowed dull.It started with a stick.  A swing at his legs.(A new king, and an iron fist)A laugh, a smile, and a second stick in his hand.(A whisper of unrest, and a quiet dissent)A wooden sword, a casual instruction.(A crowd, a voice, a worried glance)A night training, a night clash.(A night meeting and a night ambush)I loved my village, I loved them so.  In memory of my father, and in hope for my people, I fought the king’s soldiers until I had no strength, and then fought them some more.I should have seen the ones who would eventually betray me and lead my to my death; I agreed to fall upon my own sword to spare the lives of my people.But my people were not spared.… I never understood how I knew that.  How I became one with my weapon and watched the ages pass.It doesn’t matter, I suppose.I was used by the high commander of the new order of the king to slay many.  I remember him disliking me for being improperly balanced, despite my father’s master craftsmanship.  Maybe that was me, maybe that was his ineptitude.It doesn’t matter, I suppose.The kingdom eventually fell, overcome by a violent rebellion of its people from the inside, a quiet whisper that built into a roar over many tens of years.I was used to slay the king’s ancestors, but I felt no joy or disgust.  My people were gone; why would it matter?…I was put on display for centuries, never to be used in battle again.  This suited me fine, and I idly watched as my display was at first a wood hook on a wood wall, then metal frame in a glass case.  The building became old and fell in disrepair, so it didn’t take long for roof leak to appear, unnoticed.Or the crack to form in the glass.Or the moisture to build in the display, or the flecks of rust begin to appear down my length.A security guard leaned against my case every night to sleep when he shouldn’t be sleeping.A new shop set up nearby that made replicas of myself for others to buy and wave around.One dream too far, I fell to the floor in a crash, and broke.  The guard replaced me with a replica, fearful for his job and his life at a priceless broken artifact.It didn’t matter to me.  I didn’t have anything anyway.I was thrown away.…A war had begun, larger than any war before it.  I don’t remember when or how I was melted into scrap, but it didn’t matter.  I became something else; I became immense.For the first time, I felt free.With a thunder of water and a tremor of steel, I felt the water cool my hull, and the wind caress my deck.  The open air, the open ocean.It was so large.  It was so free.And then they put weapons on me.  Guns, they called them.  Cannons.  Arrow slingers, but arrows of metal, and bows of fire and steel.I was angry.  I just wanted peace; I just wanted a freedom to die or to leave.I became the problem child of their navy.  I didn’t care.  I was mad.My engines didn’t work right together, I always curved to one side.  They said it was bad calibration.  Just coincidence it was always toward open sea.  Sometimes my power flickered.  A faulty power line, they said.  Just coincidence it was always at night when the stars were brightest.  My guns would turn on their own.  Crossed wiring.  Brooms fell over during ‘rough waves’ and happened to trip some people here or there.They would say I was haunted, but who would haunt a brand new ship?Still, they dealt with my quirks.  They didn’t have a choice.And I dealt with them.  I didn’t have a choice.…Eventually, I didn’t want one.A rough storm hit and I ran aground.  They freed me and repaired me and healed me.A small skirmish had appeared, and my first shot struck.  They cheered and clapped and praised me.I didn’t like the praise for a kill, but the smiles were too infectious.  Something worried, something hopeful, something genuine.“C’mon, y’fiesty gal,” the engineer would say to me on drunken, starry nights, “you’ve got the potential, and I’ve got the tools, y’hear?  No misbehavin’ on me!”There was the young sailor who proudly showed me to his love in secret, boasting my power, my beauty, and how I would keep her and her country safe.There was the crew who laughed and gambled in my bowels, probably illegal, and probably very drunk, but happy.There were the nurses who smiled and laughed at flirting boys, shaking their heads and their advances.There was the old captain who stared down his sailor’s antics, but cracked a smile when he was sure they weren’t looking.At sunrise a song to remember their home, to remember their country and their duty.  At sunset a drink to remember their mortality, of themselves, their friends and their family.Games were played my halls.  Love was made in my halls.  Promises given, promises taken, and words of hope and of loyalty.My engines were soon calibrated properly.  My guns fixed that glitch in their wires.  The waves seemed calmer, and the power didn’t flicker as much.But sometimes they still did, briefly, when I wanted to remember the stars.…My crew was dying.I was dying.Ambushed at night, surrounded by many.  I was burning, and I was bleeding.  Oil, air, my insides were awash with sea water.We were the last of our fleet, fighting a losing battle of survival.  No capture, no surrender.  They wanted us gone.Memories brought me back to my village, long ago.  Though they claimed it, the soldiers didn’t want surrender, either.  They wanted us all dead.  I failed to protect my people, then.I will not fail them now.Even as my deck lists over, and sparks and flame lick up my walls, I keep fighting.  My engineer is drowning himself to keep my engines running.  A rock of a rough wave, and a hatch snaps shut before he can dive back in.  As he pounds on the closed portal, my engines roar despite being choked with water.My ammunition is low, they can’t see well in the darkness against glaring flame, but every shot hits; a wiring glitch causing the turrets to swivel in just way in just the right time.A broom trips a sailor before bullets could tear him.  The lights flicker, causing a shell to miss us in the dark.Loose doors and hatches inexplicably shut when compartments fill with water, keeping it from spreading to crewed quarters as long as they can.  Light flicker in the right places, drawing eyes to incoming fire and enemies.I can’t do much, but I give it my all, as much as my people who crew me.When the dawn finally arrives, I am half under, but my wake is filled with the ruin of my enemies.There’s a tired celebration, a weary song of dawn for one’s country and one’s duty.  It’s cut short by my heavy list; with a heavy heart and a sorrowful voice, my captain gives order to abandon me.But I am okay.   I gave my life to save my people, and though I failed the first time…I won’t be remembered, the king’s soldiers said.  And that remains true, except in the hearts of my men, my crew.  I am a part of them, as they are a part of me.I’ve lived a full life, and a happy one.  It was the little things that made it worth living."

I heard my family slaughtered. In an instant I felt a change within me. Fire surged through my battered body and my vision cleared. Before me I saw clearly the advancing hoard. A stepped forward, moved not by myself but the new force within me. My men followed, and I staid them with a hand. I raised my sword aloft and charged into the throng. 	Carried by instinct and rage my sword flew furiously, cutting down the enemy like wheat. I was slashed and stabbed, bludgeoned, and beat, yet I felt nothing. From behind I heard I cry, and the thunder of boots as my men came to join me. I know not how many we fighters we felled on the field that day, but when the blood-soaked field became quiet bodies covered the ground like sand covers a beach. In that moment, whatever power I had been granted left me. My men gasped as I toppled to the ground, and my sight grew hazy. The last thing I witnessed as a mortal was the sensation of my sword, cold in my hand. And In a dying breath I became steel.  	My surviving men carried me home. They buried what once was my body and placed my new one in a great hall. I listened to their tears as they mourned those they had lost; I listened to feasts they held in my honor. And though blind, though immobile, though only aware through some extrasensory force, I was satisfied. But time weakens the connection to the mortal realm, and as decades and centuries passed I felt less and less. I suspected my final journey to oblivion would soon complete, and I accepted my fate. But fate it would seem had other plans.	Centuries had lost me, and I had travelled unaware of either the destination or the road. But somehow my tarnished shell found me in a pile of scrap in a shipyard the scale of which the men of my day could never comprehend. I was awoken by a bright, piercing pain. The sensation by then was so foreign that all I knew was a sudden jolt of consciousness. Decades upon decades fell from my soul, and I felt my body grow. I felt rooms inside myself; engines and motors, rudders and blades, powerful weapons of war and thick shields of defense. And finally, I felt life. I was brought to the ocean and laid upon the water. The motor pulsed as my heart, and the blades strode like legs. Men began to occupy my rooms, and they moved through my corridors like blood. In my rooms I heard their secrets. I learned of their wives, their girlfriends, their children. I felt an old emotion surface from deep down. Once again, I was with my men, and once again I was their protector. 	But our peace could not last. After all, I was a warship, and my purpose was to taste battle. We were dispatched to foreign coasts, and my soldiers led us without fear. They laughed and fought, ate and drank, and played games. As we approached, though, my men became nervous. Whispers of a potential ambush permeated, but the garbled voices on my radio insisted they go on. I did not want my family to die but being only a passenger in my own body I was powerless. We sailed on into the treacherous territory of enemy waters. For many days we waited in anxious tension for more orders, but none arrived. My men grew restless, sometimes violent. The paced my rooms and kicked my walls. One neither ate nor slept, only looking off into the horizon. Days and nights passed with no instruction. My men began to believe we had been forgotten. Moral was low, and though I wished I could, there was no way to help them.     	Then one day a shout came from my upper deck. Somehow in the night our location had been determined and we had become surrounded. A couple of miles out in every direction the enemy was approaching. My men were scared, but they remained at their post. They knew there would be know surrender, only the hope to take as many of the enemy with them as they could. The ship approached further and then the barrage began. I felt a pain through my entire being with the first hit and felt the shock waves of missed shots all around. My men shouted orders and scream when they were lacerated with shrapnel. I was hit again, and I felt the death inside me. I felt the blood of my men stain the floors. I felt my family being taken from me once more. An artillery shell hit my side and I began to take on water. My soldiers yelled and dove overboard. Some found life rafts and tried to help the other. All I felt was the pain and chaos and twisted metal of my body. The boats approached closer, and as the evening lights dimmed the water turned red with the sky. The waves looked like hills, and the bodies of my men - living and slain - dotted them. An ancient ache rose within me, and with the scream of splitting metal in me I left my body. I travelled over my men and saw the fear their faces, and the resignation. I saw the tears that stained their cheeks for those they lost, and I saw the fast-approaching ships. Separate from my body, I felt myself dragged into oblivion, but with the last of my strength I fought the void. I sent myself out and climbed into the enemy’ s ships. I felt the walls, the motors, and the guns. I encompassed them, and heard the gasps as cracks appeared in the decks and walls. One by one the enemy ships began to sink. As I floated away I heard my men shout, first in confusion then in triumph. The cheers of men who knew that there was someone, somewhere watching over them. I bid my family goodbye one last time and slipped peacefully into nothing."
19,An ancient sword containing the spirit of it's original master accidentally gets included in a batch of scrap metal being smelted to build a mighty warship. When all seems lost in a desperate sea battle the spirit decides it is time for it to actively defend the crew it became protective of.,"Asger pierced saxon's heart with his blade. He pulled his sword out, and the saxon's corpse collapsed onto the pile of bodies around Asger.   Asger wasn't supposed to be fighting. Asger Ragnulf, feared viking warrior, was supposed to be leading his men raiding quiet seaside village.  But the seaside village turned out to be elaborate trap set up by saxons to kill Asger and end his reign of terror, and Asger and his crew of thirty men ended up being surrounded by hundred and fifty saxon warriors. Knowing that escape was impossible, Asger fought with terrifying bloodlust, falling twenty men before succumbing to sheer numbers. As he swung his sword with all his might, with his consciousness slowly fading,  he looked up to the sky and saw Valhalla waiting for him....Thousand and five hundred years later, his soul finally ended up in Valhalla....2512, UCS Valhalla, alpha centauri orbit.Captain Godfrid stood inside bridge of his ship, contemplating situation he was in. Valhalla, newly commissioned heavy cruiser of United Coalitions navy, had state of arts carbon nanotube reinforced magnesium steel hull, with active directed energy shielding that protected the ship from everything short of twenty megaton kinetic projectile. Against kinetic projectiles, the ship's AI automatically applied thrusters to maneuver out of their way. However, machine had it's limits, and combat against multiple alien capital ships was one of them. What started out as simple rescue operation of civilian ship somehow escalated into head on combat against 2 capital ships. Valhalla fought tooth and nail - more accurately, with railgun and nuclear torpedoes - but Godfrid was aware that it was a losing battle, and only thing Valhalla could do was to inflict as much damage as she can before going down....Maybe it was Godfrid's Nordic ancestry. Or maybe it was his willpower. Nevertheless, it awakened spirit of Asger on the ship, dormant in steel alloy that contained metal from Asger's sword. Asger's spirit gave Godfrid courag, determination, and most importantly, an idea. It was seemingly suicidal idea, but Godfrid somehow knew that it was going to work. Valhalla slingshotted around a planet, positioning itself behind enemy ships. Valhalla then fired a torpedo at one enemy ship, causing it to maneuver away to lose it. Using this opportunity, Valhalla rammed other enemy ship, disabling both their thrusters. First enemy ship that now lost torpedo following it fired it's torpedo on Valhalla. Valhalla, in unprecedented maneuver, used knockback from railgun to move behind enemy ship, using it as a shield against incoming torpedo. Torpedo, unable to change course, crashed into disabled alien ship, destroying it. Remaining alien ship moved towards Valhalla to board it, knowing that it is disabled and will not be able to fight back....only to realize that Valhalla is fully operational and already fired it's entire arsenal at second enemy ship. Aliens did not realize this, but Valhalla had backup generators not present in past UCS cruisers, and this allowed Valhalla to recover from collision quickly. Alien ship tried to retaliate, but Valhalla's arsenal of torpedoes and railguns overpowered defenses and destroyed last alien ship.Godfrid dismissed powerful presence he felt during battle alpha centauri as adrenaline rush, but deep inside his mind, he knew that something, or someone, was there with him in battle."
20,"Everyday, you reach into your magic bag and get whatever you will need most in the day. Most days it's a gun. But today, you got something else...","I sigh and reach into the bag, ready for my fingers to latch onto the cool metal of the usual revolver. It's been twelve days since the last time it was something else, and then it had been a semi-automatic handgun. There's velvet, velvet, and - that's not metal. I retract my hand and pull the mouth of the bag open wider to peer into it. There at the bottom is a small black kitten, eyes glinting in the dim light of the bag. ""Oh god,"" I groan, reaching back in to draw the cat out. It settles into my palms with a happy mew before flopping over to lick itself. ""What am I supposed to do with *this*?"""
21,"Everyday, you reach into your magic bag and get whatever you will need most in the day. Most days it's a gun. But today, you got something else...","Two weeks after the EMP, when I was sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that I would die in this new dark world, I found the green canvas bag, in barn still several hundred miles away from civilization. There was a shiny new .45 inside.I quickly realized that this was no ordinary bag when I was unable to put the gun back inside. It wasn't a physical incapability but not quite a mental one either.I decided to set up camp in the woods behind the barn where I'd discovered the mysterious artifact. I sat for what seemed like hours trying to break whatever force that was compelling me not to put anything into the bag. I could pick up the item that I intended to store, but there seemed to be some kind of blockage when my brain sent the orders to my hand to actually insert the item. I could push but I had no strength, like trying to scream when deep within a nightmare.The sound of rustling foliage broke my intense concentration. It was followed by rapid footfalls on the forest floor. I racked the pistol and leveled it in the direction of the noise. The man's knife glinted in the light of the fire. I unloaded in his general direction, and he hit the ground face first like a sack of potatoes and half slid, half rolled across the ground almost to my feet. The next morning I looked at the bag only to see another gun shaped mass silhouetted inside of it. I looked to gun I had pulled from the bag the previous day, still sitting next to my bed roll. I had no idea what was happening, had someone else snuck into my camp and put another gun in the bag? There was no way I could have just missed the fact that another gun was in there but I knew that whatever was going on, it was time to move on.After two weeks I was sure of two things in relation to the nature of the bag. Firstly each day when I awoke there would be a new item or sometimes multiple items in the bag. These item's seemed to be whatever I would need most, whatever was the most detrimental to my survival or success that day. Though sometimes it seemed entirely random.Second the bag didn't seem to care whether or not I already had such an item, it would just give me one anyways. This was becoming increasingly annoying as I now had 8 different hanguns and 4 knives.By the fourth week, Gun count: 17, I had become aware of several more properties of my faithful, yet somewhat infuriating, companion. The bag would give me a weekly ration of food, but in it's usual overtly inconvenient style the bag didn't seem to care which day I would recieve the food or even how much food it would be, in fact it almost seemed purposefully malicious. Midway through the first week, nearly starving, I recieved 37 cans of spam, I famously hated spam, and nearly decided to just allow myself to starve to death. The second week, on monday, I got a single radish, I was subsequently forced to continue gagging with every bite of every meal, choking down can after can of congealed ""meat"". I ran out of spam and wasn't given anymore food until the following sunday when I recieved 12 MREs dated 1968. I was pleasently surprised to find that the freeze dried foods didn't actually seem to be fifty plus years old and was ecstatic to find small packs of Marlboro reds within the care packages. The next day, a new week, I recieved 58 more cans of spam.I also learned that if the item I was being so benevolently bestowed was too large for the bag, the little green satchel would simply grow to envelope the item. I came into this knowledge when I was rudely awoken at the crack of dawn by the blood curdling screams of a panicking animal. I jumped to my feet, gun in hand, only to see a gigantic writhing green mass in my camp.It was quite obviously a horse and carriage, and I was then left with the task of extracting a giant panicking beast AND carriage from a big, stupid, green bag. After several hours of comically ridiculous antics I was finally able to free the horse and carriage. On one hand I was greatful, because I now had too much bag-junk to carry on my own, but once again the bag bested me as I was unable travel that day. This was on account of the fact that I hadn't any room for my supplies because the bag did not shrink back to normal size and took almost all the room in the carraige.After only several minutes of rest the horse looked at me in the most peculiar way.""How the fuck did I get in there?"" He asked."
22,"Everyday, you reach into your magic bag and get whatever you will need most in the day. Most days it's a gun. But today, you got something else...","You reach into the bag, expecting the cold metal of the revolver which had been your faithful companion for weeks. Instead, you feel rough fabric, with a hard plate under it. There's a second one, just like it. With a little struggling, you pull out a bulletproof vest. ""Shit."""
23,Never tell a human they CANT do something. They seem to take it as a challenge EVERY TIME!,"When Man was born, Nature said to him, ""You are weak. You have not claws to fight danger, nor fangs to slay your prey, nor fur to weather the cold. You cannot compete with the bear, the saber-tooth, the mammoth.""So Man slew the bear and severed its claws, slew the saber-tooth and stole its fangs, and slew the mammoth and claimed its fur. And Man took these for himself, and grew stronger.Then Nature said to Man, ""You are stronger, but not enough. You are blind in the darkest of nights, yet you cannot steal the eyes of the beasts.""So Man took flint and struck it against stone, and created fire. With that he no longer feared the night, and he grew stronger.Nature said to Man, ""You are stronger, yet still weak. You are disorganized, chaotic, vulnerable. You will surely succumb to the if you remain alone.""So Man drew symbols and created words, and built himself languages. And with those he created civilizations, tens of thousands working towards a common goal, and he grew stronger.Nature said to Man, ""You are stronger, but far from perfect. You still have nothing but your two hands, and you will build nothing with those hands.""So Man harnessed fire and lightning and built monsters of wood and iron. And these monsters took on the tasks of Man, and Man grew stronger.Nature said to Man, ""You are stronger, though still lacking. You are stranded on this planet of earth and water. You will never reach the stars above.""So Man built himself a new beast, a long spear of steel that spewed fire and carried him into the sky. He reached the pale moon that was once only a distant dream, and claimed it as his own, and he grew stronger.And at last, Nature said to Man, ""You have conquered my trials and grown stronger, but you will never conquer yourself. You are violent and selfish. You kill your brothers and sisters, and bring ruin to the land of your ancestors. You create weapons that would destroy the world ten times over, and praise those who would gladly use them. You are headed towards ruin, and there is nothing you can do.""So once again, Man fought back.I've been sitting on this idea for a while. I had originally intended to post this in /r/hfy at some point, but this works too. Also, if you enjoyed this, you may be interested in my other stories at /r/jwfiredragonwrites."
24,God has a cell phone and is really bad at following up on text messages,"Sam kneels down at the foot of his bed. A zealous and erudite man, he had belonged to Gods flock all his life. Recently, however, the devil had found its way into his heart. A vice like grip was now held over him. Gambling. He could not stop. His finances quickly melting away as his relationship with God wavered. He knelt before the grace of God, determined to bring it to an end. He clasps his hands together in prayer.  ""Lord, I have fallen away from your light. The devil consumes my soul with an addiction I cannot fight. Help give me the strength to fight this. Have mercy on me and wash away my sins. Give me a sign. With your glory, I hope to defeat this."" Standing up, Sam looks out of his window into the morning sky. This new strife has rocked to his very core. For the first time he finds himself unsure if God is really listening, or if he even exists. Suddenly, the clouds whiz across the sky, forming giant fluffy letters as they fuse together. Sam feels his faith ignited within him once more. Truly, a wondrous act of God was befalling his very eyes. He watched as the clouds turned into letters, reading out the holy inscription that formed in the sky. "
25,"You die and go to Heaven, only to find out that your lover was sent to Hell. You beg God to take pity, but it's actually Satan that hears you.","""Please, there has to be something you can do! She really was a good person."" God looked at me with pity but just shook his head ""I'm sorry son, she didn't make the cut, there has to be rules."" How could this be heaven if Samantha wasn't here with me, we had been together 17 years before the accident happened. ""Get some sleep my child, you've had a long day. You'll like it here."" God had an angel show me to my new house and of course it was everything I'd ever dreamed of. After the angel left the phone rang, who could be calling, I literally just got here. ""Hello?"" ""Jonathan! Hi, uhm, so, I don't usually do things like this but you seem pretty nice and all and God, I mean he's kinda a dick huh?"" ""Uhm, who is this?""""Oh ya, sorry, it's Lucifer."" ""Like, THE Lucifer, the Devil?""""Ya, king of darkness, all that jazz. Let's just skip over that for now, I have your wife here and I was kinda eavesdropping on your little talk with God and I think we came up with a solution for everyone."" ""Uh, ya, alright, what's going on?"" ""You can come be down here with your wife whenever you want and there's just one small thing I need from you."" ""Yes, anything!!"" ""I need an assistant and I hear you're really good at Excel."""
26,"You die and go to Heaven, only to find out that your lover was sent to Hell. You beg God to take pity, but it's actually Satan that hears you.","""You... you must be mistaken.""""I'm afraid not.""""She... there's no way she was a killer.""""It's no surprise you don't know. It was before she met you."" God explained, flipping through her file. ""In her early twenties, she was extremely mysandristic, and killed 27 young men. After five years, the police started to catch on, and she fled the region, going nearly half the distance it takes to get from one US coast to the other. You met her about a year later.""I cradled my head and leaned forward.""It may comfort you to know she wasn't a sociopath. She did love you, and she was sorry for what she did, eventually. But she never did turn herself in.""""But I... I'm never gonna see her again?""""Well-""The door to the office burst open. ""Not hardly."" Said a firm voice, tinged with rage. I turned to see a handsome, middle-aged man in a well-tailored suit carrying a briefcase. He seemed quite frustrated, but when he laid his eyes on me his gaze softened and he smiled.He strode up to the desk, then turned to me, and with a short bow, offered out his hand. ""Mr. Bishop, I presume?""""Yes?""""Lucifer, pleased to meet your acquaintance. I'll be representing you and your wife."" He sat down in the arm chair beside me, giving an even shorter bow as he did so. ""Good day, Father."" He said simply and quietly.God furrowed his brow. ""And to you. What brings you here?""""Well it seems me and my associates have been misinformed as to the situation regarding Mrs. Bishop.""""Misinformed?""""Yes. In fact, we were led to believe she was an unrepentant sociopath. No one was even told she had a spouse.""""Well, I think that hardly changes the situation.""""I-I'm confused..."" I finally spoke out. ""Right."" Lucifer responded, crossing his legs. ""You see, no one stays in hell forever. It's all temporary. Even Hitler will eventually get out.""""*Hitler*?""""*Eventually*."" He pulled a pad of paper and pen from his breast pocket, and began scribbling some figures. ""You see, the suffering is to make people understand the pain they've caused, and to help them truly feel sorry. Various factors play in to how long someone will stay, and coming from different living situations can make their suffering impact them more, or less."" He look up from the pad. ""So tell me, your wife died 23 years before you, correct?""""That's right.""""And you were together until then?""""Yes.""""Any talk of divorce or fights?""""No, never.""""Did you become involved with anyone else after her death?"" ""Never even dreamt of it."" God was growing increasingly impatient.""Being separated from a close lover can decrease time spent in Hell greatly. Did she ever do any charity?""""Yeah, she made monthly donations to male rape victim support groups.""""This contradicts her greatest sins in life, implying, if not confirming, that she repented during her life, also greatly diminishing the time she should've spent.""God sighed in frustration. ""How much time does she have left?""""Well, an unrepentant murderer would normally have QUITE a lot longer to serve. But if we add up her emotions, her happy marriage, her efforts to repent during life..."" Lucifer drew a line then took a few seconds to write the final figure, then he frowned. ""Oh look, it would seem *we owe her time*,"" Lucifer said through clenched teeth, and turned the pad to show the results to God. The paper was covered in a mixture of recognizable, albeit it complex, math, and strange symbols. But the results at the bottom were clear; -3 years.""I believe we're done here."" Lucifer stood.""So... my wife is going to be released?""""Immediately, Mr. Bishop. Unfortunately, there's nothing to be done about the time owed to you two."" He turned back to God. ""As for you, Father, you *must* send me the *entire* file from now on.""God gave another sigh. ""If you insist...""Lucifer beckoned me to follow him out of the room, and I did.""Why is he like that?"" I asked as we walked down the wide, white hallway.""My father likes punishing evildoers a little too much. He also has several trillion cases to go through, so he doesn't like to sweat over the details.""We reached the front office, and sitting in one of the chairs was my wife.""Lewis?"" She stood up, her eyes wide in disbelief.""Emily!"" I ran over to her and hugged her.""Lewis! I... I'm so sorry I never told you..."" She sniffled.""Shh, it's ok, it's gonna be ok."" I pressed my face into her hair, taking in everything about her for the first time in what felt like an eternity. Finally I pried myself away to turn to Lucifer. ""Thank you so much for your help.""Lucifer smiled and simply said ""Anytime,"" before leaving the office."

He spent the better part of two hours sweating and cursing under his fiery breath.""What're you muttering about again, old lizard?"" a voice as pleasant as the sound of a mosquito in a tent inquired. ""Need any help?""""Piss off, I'm just find on my own thank you. No need for your sticky fingers to magically turn pounds into pennies you bat-eared freak!""The inquirers ears were indeed bat-like: perpendicular to his skull and almost perfectly round. Between them, a sly, mocking grin spread wide across bluish shoe-string lips. A pair of small, beady eyes inspected the coin purse that was the object of Frederick's misery.""Struck a chord, there, old chum?""It was impossible to tell which chin began shaking first as the rotund figure emitted a wheezing belly-laugh at Frederick's irritation.""What do you want, Belfort?""A small, angry flame flicked out of Frederick's mouth as he painstakingly counted his pennies. Though a dragon he was, Frederick's upper extremities more closely resembled forks than forearms, which made counting coins rather difficult. Indeed, he had to push his head far to the front and nearly lay it down to be able to reach the ground. Belfort performed a small dance around the lizard's moneybag.""Oh, nothing, just offering to help an old friend. Say, Frederick, have you ever considered getting a job?""Frederick stopped counting. He raised his head, easily the size of Belfort's entire body and studded with horns, and pointed one eye at his portly interlocutor. Red and yellow, with a vertical slit down the middle, much like that of a cat. Or a lizard.""Don't you think, I've tried, Belfort? Nobody needs dragons these days. There are no princesses to keep locked up in towers anymore, and not for want of princesses. They just don't do that sort of thing anymore. Every since Palmyra, Princess of Dunderland and heiress to King Wubblebum's fortune escaped her tower -- you know, the one guarded by Steve -- and told the press it was all a racket to generate donations for the White Knights Order, the market's completely gone down the tubes. The town criers gassed on about it for weeks! And all because Palmyra didn't get what she thought was a fair cut of the kickbacks! Greedy bastards, the lot of them...""Belfort's grin receded into a thoughtful pout, as the fat, hairless dwarf rubbed his chin. Frederick returned to counting his coins.""What about getting into the transportation business, Frederick? Surely you could take to the skies with a gaggle of gullible tourists on your back?""""Nobody trusts a dragon anymore, Belfort. It's a miracle people have the charity to give me their alms every day,"" the dragon paused as he dropped the last coin into a small, wooden box hanging from his neck between his arms. ""There. Thirty-one pounds and twelve pence, Belfort. Today has been a good day.""Belfort smirked.""Do you me to tell you how much I made in the last twelve hours?""""No,"" said Frederick, ""You're a conman and a thief. Even if I don't make much, I do it honestly.""The horizontally-challenged blob of pasty flesh that called itself 'Belfort' pursed its thin lips and blew a raspberry that echoed, like the quacking of a duck, under the Wilfred Bunt Memorial Bridge."
28,"Problems and illnesses manifest themselves as little monsters, invisible to all but the owner at first, but growing in size proportional to the problem and becoming visible when they start to affect others. One day you see a little boy riding a giant beast while laughing.","He flicked his cigarette, letting the ashes flutter and land on his knees.  People-watching on the sidewalk curled up into the shape of a question mark was a new hobby he had picked up, and he'd seen a fair share of creatures climb through his part of the woods. But this... He stared at burnt rubber soles of a pair of off-brand sneakers, trailing his gaze upward. The kid had a bright pair of neon yellow shorts, a purple tank top torn at the left shoulder, and a brown patch of hair protruding like a tree trunk from the right side of his head. There were weirder looking kids in Portland, sure, but not all of them were riding a 50-foot-tall, pinky, faceless humanoid with vines for limbs. Of course, these monsters weren't all misplaced themselves. He'd dealt with a ton of them in grief counseling classes, talking to mothers who had lost their children in the forests. Their little monsters were always little birds singing sad little songs, perched on their shoulders, reminding them of their ""little angels"" no one could find. He took another drag. Smoke spilled from his nostrils as he exhaled, nodding at the memories. Search and rescue was a tough job, and more often than not, he'd have cold cases, never find the kid -- or, in the more fortunate cases, they'd probably find the little shit lurking by a mulberry bush tossing stuffed animals into the air, pretending that they had their own little monsters. ""Hey, mister!""A small squishy palm almost swiped the cigarette from his mouth before he pulled his head back and out of the way. He squinted at the dirty child. ""Mister, you like my friend? Been seeing you staring at him from over here, and I thought you wanted to play with us.""He flicked a couple of ashes at the child. Instead of moving away, the kid let the ashes fall in a line across his shoes, his smile ever present. ""What's your problem, kid?""""Problem? That's Glasglow.""""Cut the bullshit, kid. It isn't your friend. That,"" he said, pointing with his cigarette to the humanoid rolling in the street, ""only gets born when people are sick or are having a hard time.""The little boy's smile faltered. His little foot scuffed the ashes on the ground. ""Mister,"" he said, ""he really is my only friend. Been with me since I was born."" ""Since when?""""Since all of those kids went missing, Mister.""His cigarette dropped to the ground as his covered his mouth, choking on smoke. ""What?""The child laughed. The air around him began flutter with waves of heat. ""Oh, you remember, Mister. Kids gone missing every week for almost a year, not a single one found. Don't you play the dummy, sir.""The humanoid on the street jerked its giant head towards the two of them. In a swift corkscrew motion, it swiveled its way next to the child. He lurched at the smell of rotting flesh emanating from where its face should have been, staring in horror as rows of teeth began to appear. ""I... I don't know what you're talking about.""""Oh, I'm sure. Leaving a cigarette behind, 'forgetting' to put it out--you sure thought you were a slick one, didn't you, Mister?"" The humanoid next to the child smiled, displaying three sharp and shiny rows of teeth. A boulder-sized lump manifested in the middle of its throat and surged toward the mouth. With a violent spasm, it vomited a ball of charred, severed heads, arms, and feet. His hands shook and with a lurch, he too emptied the contents of his stomach onto the sidewalk. The boy looked down at him, indifferent and cold. ""That's right, Mister. We've come back for you. You thought we'd burn with the rest of the forest, but guilt sure does manifest itself in different ways, doesn't it?""Vomit spilled from between his fingers, but he managed to spit in the boy's general direction. ""You're a disgusting little monster.""The humanoid's vines curled around the little boy's leg. The child's skin broiled, blisters climbing up his body. He smiled, his jaw distending to show three rows of sharp, bright teeth. ""You're the real monster, Mister."""

The kid laughed, trying to get it back from them.“We tell kids not to be embarrassed about their monsters, and that we can help them get rid of them. Some still treat them like imaginary friends, and by the time we catch it, it’s too late.”“Too late?”“Stage four terminal cancer. They don’t have a chance.”I watched the kid play with its giant monster, and wished I hadn’t asked."

One day you see a little boy riding a giant beast while laughing.","We all have our monsters, the things that never seem to leave us no matter how hard we try to bottle them up or drink them away. All we can do is hope and pray that our monsters don't grow bigger than us. Some people see therapists for pills to drug their beasts into submission, others self medicate, and an unlucky few never find their reprieve. I myself have lived a privileged life and have not experienced much heartbreak, but it's a double edged sword. My own daunting fear of losing everything good in my life has become my own monster. It's a scaly thing with beady eyes and a hungry smile. I was the only one who could see him at first, but as my good fortune continued and I had more to lose, my little gremlin never went hungry. I envy those who are so care free they lack a visible monster, but this is a rare luxury these days. That said, I have never seen something quite like this before. A little boy, riding atop his own monster, laughing maniacally. His rolling laughter was loud enough to still be audible over his mother's screams. The curdling sound had sent jolts of fear and panic through the shopping center, and my stomach dropped as the source of the horror came into view. The boy's eyes were wild; whatever plagued him had a firm grip. The mother was sobbing, pleading with her son to calm down, that things would get better, that he still had so much to live for. His monster reared up at these words and snarled, blood red lips curling around razer teeth. The boy quickly stopped laughing, and his shoulders went slack. His mother let out one final scream, and time seemed to stop completely as the monster threw the boy off his shoulders and caught him in his mouth, swallowing him whole. The monster threw back his head and laughed, the same laugh of the boy, but distorted and demonic as it faded away. I was frozen in horror, my entire body sweating as I processed what had transpired. His mother's sobs were a faint echo in my head as my own monster looked up at me greedily, much taller than he had been before. We may try all our lives to defeat our monsters. But if we aren't careful, our monsters will consume us."

The only problem is, she hasn’t accounted for the fact that all the answers are readily available to anyone with a WiFi connection.","""Oh no! Not you again."" The Sphinx. Greatest and most magical creature in all of history rolled its eyes and slumped. The dune under which it had been previously hiding rolled away in a wave as its enormous lions body thundered down, almost completely burying the limited edition 'Desert-Roamer' Sports car Deluxe which shot backwards as the desert shifted against the star strewn night.""Tttthhhe paintwoooooork!"" A small voice shrieked as the car's tracks bit into the dust and spun around. A smartly dressed man jumped out of the hideously expensive car and ran around it in a circle checking every inch. Stopping to polish dusty chromework and untouched paintwork. ""Can't you just leave me alone?"" The defeat was clear in the Sphinx's once mighty voice.The man straightened, brushed his perfect suit clean of imaginary dust and turned to face The Sphinx. He pursed his lips and lifted his chin, looking down his nose at the unholy creature. He thought this look gave him power, but really he just looked like a toad caught mid ribbit. ""You must be happy with what you've got by now!"" The Sphinx moaned, whipping its despondent tail across the desert sand. ""Money and women. Political influence and global fame. What more do you want?"" He had the creature right where he wanted it. The first time he found it he thought he was dead, but his smartphone had saved him and then his wish made him rich and powerful. His second catching of the creature been more for sport and now he couldn't keep count. Each time he caught it he had grown through the wishes he made. It had become his servent and from time to time, he would remind it of this. ""Aren't you going to ask me a question?"" The man pulled back his ratty lips exposing a perfect Hollywood smile. The Sphinx rose up onto its feet and stretched out its wings pawing the ground with its razor sharp talons. It faced the smug little man, threw its head back and laughed. It lifted its giant paw and squashed the man flat.""I already did"" the Sphinx rumbled.Edit: thank you so much for the love guys :-)"

For  decades I've lived the life of a nomad, forever restless, forever wandering. Across the yellow dunes and the dust and rubble I've travelled, unencumbered by the yolk of civilization, by the shakles of humanity. I've become an animal. Hunt or be hunted, as my father always told me. Today, I am finally the hunter. Today, I have finally found my prey. The tomb has no right to be bright. It has hidden from the light for a millenia, shunned the years of blood and tears, turned its back on the very people who needed it most. But bright it is. As though its golden walls have been drenched in sun. Through an almost ethereal like prism, I see it. The only thing in this cavernous chamber that remains dark. It does not want to be found, but found it has been. It does not want to awake, but awake it shall. The Sphinx. The greatest wonder of this world in which we suffer. A whisper in the wind. A myth, a tale whispered only when the night is at its darkest, when the moon no longer shines, and when the stars have disappeared. To the uneducated mind, it is the least impressive artefact in the room. The most... innocuous, dull. Incongruous, a shadow in contrast to the glittering emeralds and the shining gold with which it has been entombed. I can't help but chuckle as I lay my hand on its rusted surface. For too many years it has bested me. Evaded my every effort to find it. Laughed at my dreams. No longer. Today, the Sphinx awakes from her slumber. Today, I shall arise from my prison, stronger than ever. And no one will stand in my way. I mumble words forgotten by time, utter verses a mortal could never comprehend. The room fades, as the statue begins to glow, pulsating softly as its power returns. And now, she stands before me, in all her lethal beauty. But I do not cower. I do not balk from her fearsome gaze. No. I smile. Armed with Wi-Fi, I cannot be defeated. Not again. Never again.My first wish? No more internet. For you, that is. No more ""power to the people."" No, we shall return to the days of old, you and I. For you, dear mortal, the days of servitude. I have returned, my children...(Feedback always appreciated!)r/samfoxstories "
34,"The Sphinx has reawakened and will grant the wishes of anyone who can guess the answer to her riddles. The only problem is, she hasn’t accounted for the fact that all the answers are readily available to anyone with a WiFi connection.","Some people say that the Great Revelation changed everything, but I know differently. Sure, suddenly all sorts of mythological creatures were running around, magic was revealed to actually exist, and people started being born with superpowers, but humans were, fundamentally, humans. And I know about human nature more than most people, because I’m a history teacher, to high schoolers no less.On the whole, it’s very difficult to get middle schoolers to learn about history, but that’s not the real problem that I’ve been facing recently. No, the problem is that people don’t know how to research properly, even with the use of smartphones. There’s just no motivation for them to dig deeply into a subject. But if students didn’t get taught critical thinking skills at a young age, then they’d get screwed when they were older, a prime target for con artists, Sidhe, or, worse, politicians.Fortunately, one of the great things about living in a post-Great Revelation world is that it’s a lot harder to believe in impossibilities. And I had been pretty good at thinking outside the box anyway before the world changed. Sure enough, before long, I had come up with an ingenious solution to the problem. It was possibly illegal, most likely immoral, and unquestionably unethical. But it had to be done.Some cities had found that they had been sharing space with hibernating dragons or frost giants or werewolves. My town of Eastport, Maine had somehow managed to get its hands on a real, actual sphinx, riddles and all. No one was sure exactly how she managed to end up here, but theories abound, each as ridiculous as the next, and given the nature of our current reality, each one equally likely to be true. “If I drink, I die!” shouted the sphinx as I approached her lair, also known as the only bridge out of the island that Eastport was on. “If I eat, I am fine! What am I?” I pulled out my smartphone and typed the riddle into Google. I got the answer within seconds. “A fire,” I said. The sphinx scowled, but stepped aside. She had gotten increasingly cranky these last few months, because everyone had been able to answer her riddles with the wonders of the Internet. The arcane magical laws that had been interwoven into the sphinxes at the dawn of creation hadn’t accounted for smartphones. I didn’t move. “Actually, I didn’t come here to access the bridge. I came here to talk to you. I have a proposal for you, one that would be of mutual benefit.” “Then speak, mortal,” the sphinx said wearily.“You need better riddles,” I explained, “and I need my students – as well as the rest of the people in this town – to develop better researching skills and more knowledge. Sure, they’ll use their smartphones, but it’ll be a challenge for them. I’ll provide you with better riddles, with historical inquiries. In exchange, you have to promise not to kill anyone who fails.”The sphinx scowled at me, but I could tell that she was intrigued. “If I do not punish travelers, I will wither and die. It is written. I cannot change my nature, any more than you can stop breathing and still live.”“I beg to differ,” I said calmly. “If history has taught me one thing, it is always that our nature can be overcome. Naturally good people can become savage monsters; naturally evil people can become noble saints. A sphinx can become more than what was written. You can become more.” “How?”I had thought this over very carefully. “In the old days, when a traveler heard your riddles, they were often carrying nothing more than the clothes on their backs. You had no choice but to deprive them of their lives, because they had nothing valuable otherwise. Today, things are different. People travel by car on this bridge. If they fail, you can confiscate those cars. They can walk instead.” “Can I, though?” the sphinx wondered. “Would that not violate mortal law?”“What do you care about mortal law? What do I care about mortal law? Without proper researching skills, without proper critical thinking, the people who create that law will be nothing more than the most audacious hucksters. I don’t want that, and probably neither do you. If they give you the answer within twenty-four hours, you give them back their car. If not, then you can sell it, or crush it, or eat it, or whatever you want.”The sphinx paced back and forth. Her expression was, for lack of a better term, sphinxlike, but I could tell that I was on the verge of hooking her. “I don’t know…”I smiled at her. “Well, how’s about this for an argument? If you don’t take my deal, if you don’t adapt to the changing times, you will wither away and die.” The sphinx admitted I had a point there, and the deal was struck. From then on, Eastport became known for having the most incisive, most challenging sphinx this side of Egypt, as well as some of the most well-learned students. The test scores in my class soared and the critical thinking skills that they learned from their many run-ins with the sphinx helped make sure that the standardized test scores went up correspondingly. I frequently saw townspeople perusing the history books in the library. The sphinx, out of gratitude for my help, let me out of the town without having to answer any questions, but I answered them anyway because it was fair.It took a while, but it was finally discovered that I was the one who was feeding the sphinx her new riddles. I think the fact that I accidentally used one of the riddles as a final exam question two days *before* the sphinx used it was the smoking gun, but people had been suspecting me for a while. I was worried that I was going to get into legal trouble, but the city council decided not to throw the book at me in the end. I was the sphinx’s silent partner, and the sphinx had put Eastport on the map, literally in a few cases. Without me, the tourism revenue that they had gotten from people journeying here from far away to see the Sphinx of Eastport was gone.But, honestly, teaching is getting kind of boring. I’ve more or less accomplished everything that I sought to achieve. I think I’ll go in a different field. Counselor to magical creatures sounds like fun. After all, I think I did a good job with my first try."

Now, a new name appearing in the number one spot, impossible. Every day, for the last four days, there has been a new face on Forbe's number one spot. Special Agent Knox, sat in economy class on his flight from Washington to Cairo, a total journey of seventeen hours, with a layover in Dubai. An FBI badge glued to his head would be less obvious than his suit, clean-shaven face and his crew cut. He slept, he tried to work, he watched a couple of movies, but nothing seemed to distract from the interview he had conducted two days prior. He read the unclassified transcript of his interview with Steve Burman, a forty-one-year-old, who had been the first new multi-billionaire. Steve had been courteous; he was not the sharpest tool in the box, but he lawyered up faster than Knox could make coffee. Knox interview two other new faces, a thirty-year-old woman, Lisa Hudson,  followed Steve's lawyer approach and before the FBI knew it the two of them were walking out arms wrapped around the best lawyers money could buy. The last new face had been an eighteen-year-old, Brent Alderwood, he was sunburnt beyond belief, his face still wore badges of adolescence, and he was scared. Brent, at the time, was currently the wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of over one-hundred and fifty billion dollars. He caved before Knox even sat down. He erupted into a fit of verbal diarrhoea, which led to Knox's trip to Egypt. Knox met Special Agent Phillips at the Cairo arrivals gate, Phillips had been sent out two days before Knox, having found that the first two new billionaires had both returned from Egypt. 'How was your flight?' Phillips extended a paw-like hand towards Knox, who shook it. 'Long.' 'Do you have it?' Phillips' eyes were glittering. They left the airconditioned airport to humidity that stuck in Knox's throat. 'Yes, I have it.' Knox said while he swallowed, what felt like, molten air. The hotel was modest, above average for an overseas expedition. Knox crashed within five minutes of reaching his room, a combination of the ten hours time difference and recycled aeroplane air made for the perfect nightcap. The sun woke Knox; he rolled out of bed and nearly accused the clock of lying. Ten. With tender fingers, he checked his phone for notifications. Fifteen missed calls. Shit. Adding to his problems, the brown envelope he had carefully transported from Washington to Cairo was missing from his jacket pocket. The envelope held the classified transcript of the Brent Alderwood interview, which details the location of the Sphinx.Knox rapped on Phillip's door, greeted by cold silence. Knox then tried to call him, answer phone.  Knox caught a cab to the Sphinx, located between two of the significant tourist pyramids; it was a gigantic cordoned off sand coloured statue. Up-close, it appeared to be moving, ever so slightly, like it was breathing. There was no sign of Phillips, but Knox drew level with the Sphinx's human head, its mouth lumbered open and forced Knox to recoil. 'Answer my riddle, and you will be granted one wish.' It spoke in an archaic language that somehow, Knox still understood. He had read the classified interview hundreds of times, Brent had spoken on a wish giving Sphinx, he had wished to be the wealthiest person alive. It was understood as a codename, not an actual Sphinx. The FBI believed it to be an Egyptian hacker who, under the name of Sphinx. 'I uh, I can't' Knox said. The Sphinx tilted its head; its eyes seemed to look straight through him. 'What's the matter? Your friend was keen to answer.' 'He was?' Knox didn't want to mention that Phillips was in no way his friend. 'One simple riddle. Anything can be yours.' The low paying job, the promise of riches and the allure of this ancient Sphinx was sending Knox into a trance.'What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, three legs in the evening, and no legs at night?' Knox used his phone as many others had, but he had not wished for wealth. That was stupid, he wished for something far greater."
36,"Humanity had mastered Intergalactic travel around 7.2 million years ago and sent out ships to Andromeda. Since then, we've forgotten our heritage and today, an Ancient Human ship turns up in orbit around Earth.","Something was clearly very wrong.Ever since their deceleration and entrance into the Oort cloud, the crew found themselves surrounded by deafening silence from the Sol system.Not a single Earth Defense Outpost responded to hails when they entered the primary cargo lane for mining traffic for Earth.  Not a single observation vessel asking for their call signs.Nothing.Comms went through every single channel.  Government, civilian, industrial, military, each line dead.  Dead, dead, dead.A strange tune for a once bustling corner of the Milky Way.They passed Pluto and found nothing.  Sure, it was a backwater and only use for launching between systems, but you could usually find at least one or two orbital stations selling cheap tubes of nutrient paste or some hand me down weapons from some forgotten colonial dust up.  But nothing.  Not even debris in the orbit, just the same sad little rock.  Past the gas giants.  Now the concern had begun to spread around the crew.  Their systems had taken some damage when they arrived in Andromeda, passing too close to a gas giant during deceleration.  Too much energy spent preventing the vessel from crashing and folding into the center of the planet.Quietly the captain began to review the protocol for a code black, and even though he believed in the strength of the Human Empire, in his heart he began to grapple with the truth.A spacefaring race knows the greatest enemy in colonization is time.  For hundreds of years, all humans knew.  Time was relative.Relativity was the enemy.When a crew departed from orbit, they knew fairly well that those they left behind would likely be dead when they returned.Such was life for a pioneer.When they went past Saturn, everybody knew.  They had tracked the body, searching for additional vehicle traffic.Nothing.Nothing.Silence.The Titan Station, home to humanity's greatest space station, outside of the modern civilian platforms in orbit around Earth, was nowhere to be seen.  No ruins.  No debris.  No energy waves of any kind, completely undetectable.It was just a rock.Just like all the others.Another great truth about space travel.  It's a maddeningly lonely business.Some in the crew began to panic.  They'd returned to the Sol system for repairs, and something had gone terribly wrong.  Not a single human anywhere.  To the captain, it was just sad.  He'd been born among the twinkling lights of Titan, watching military craft dock and restock before taking the fight to whatever colony had decided to rebel.  Stern men with stern faces.  He wondered what had happened, but put it from his mind.  They would most likely never know.It made the rest of the return a little more bearable.  When you finally accept a horrible truth, the cascade of additional horrible realities tend to be more palatable.  Nothing by Jupiter.  Nothing by Mars; the planet in fact had lost its artificial magnetosphere.  The place would have been entirely uninhabitable for quite a long time, and Earth installations had been deep underground anyway.  Experimental technology only, on Mars.  A sad red ball.Now onto the sad blue ball.In came signals, but these were ancient and primitive in nature.  Neither were they actually directed towards the craft.Radio?Were they fucking serious?It could be worse.  There could be no signal.They found the words strange and indecipherable.  Not a single one of the languages spoken and intercepted matched any other on record.And the planet was clearly occupied by humans, but the crew had no idea the nature of the situation.  Were they a unified race?  What had happened?  Where were the orbital stations?  Their cities were large, but clearly dirty.  Much of it appeared to still be destroyed after some great conflict, ash and charred material all over different parts of the world.The craft landed instead of staying in orbit.  Whatever help they would receive, they would have to interact with the humans on the surface.Down they went, landing within a desert.  Barren but beautiful.  Humans arrived fairly soon afterward, in olive jeeps with great white stars upon them.  The captain and crew came out to greet their fellow humans.They were all civilians.An observational mining group, tagging particularly abundant rock planets for consumption and processing.All unarmed.  All in plain garments, so as to prevent scaring whatever humans they came across.  Here they were all people, and people help each other.The men in the jeeps shot them all dead with little warning with primitive kinetic weapons and captured the craft, spiriting it away for study.  They congratulated themselves on a job well done, shaking hands.  No one took pictures of the corpses, which were burned rather than buried.To the humans that lived nearby, to the best of their knowledge nothing had happened really.Their military told them it was just a weather balloon that had fallen to the ground.Somewhere near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.r/storiesfromapotato - *X files theme plays softly in the background, a potato and a knife in a flying saucer*"
37,"Humanity had mastered Intergalactic travel around 7.2 million years ago and sent out ships to Andromeda. Since then, we've forgotten our heritage and today, an Ancient Human ship turns up in orbit around Earth.","Silje had heard stories of earth from her grandmother, she’d been one of the original colonists on the Earth Ship Aurora, that had left earth all those years ago. Time dilation meant the earth her grandmother had left would be vastly different now, although only three generation removed from Earthers, those born on earth, 7.2 million years would have past for Earth. That was the reason Silje now commanded the Andromeda Ship Aurora. When it had arrived in the Andromeda system they had expected a welcome party. See by the time the original colonists had arrived, earth would have had 3.6 million years to improve on engine design as well as theoretical physics such as quantum teleportation. There was a premise based on the fact that at the time the Aurora had left earth, technological advancement had been growing exponentially since The Time of Steam. The premise was that any ship that was sent to a distant star from earth, would be beat to their destination by a ship with superior technology that had launched long after the original ship had. But there was no welcome party, and for the 60 years it took the get the Aurora ready for the return trip, nothing had arrived from earth at all. A further 44 years had passed since a young 20 year old go getter had taken command of said ship and taken it back out into the stars. There had been celebration on launch day, finally they could reconnect with earth, but every single person knew that something must have gone terribly wrong. For Earth to not send any other vessels at all, not even a second Colony class ship from the Aurora line, something had to be up. There was plans when the Aurora left for a further four ships to leave in the following ten years, the next ship had already been named the Swan Song and begun production. Silje was interrupted from her thoughts by a voice addressing her“Captain, we’re approaching the asteroid belt now, still no signs of any vessels or space stations” Silje looked to her left and gave her second in command a thin smile before reaching down to pick up a small communication unit ready to address the whole ship.“To all members of the Andromeda Ship Aurora, we are now on our final approach to earth. As of yet we’ve found next to know evidence of human life within the Sol solar system, but we have picked up signals from earth, mostly old methods of communication but evidence of a planet wide communications network. We can’t be sure what awaits us on earth so I want all security teams in full tactical gear and on stand by-” A warning light on Siljes console in front of her interrupted her train of thought, she muted her communications before addressing her bridge.“Status report”“Captain, there is a small vessel approaching us” Replied one of the helmsman, gesturing to the observation screen as he brought up an image showing a small shape moving towards them.“Why are we only seeing this now?”Silje asked, concern creeping into her voice“It appears to be adrift, it’s being propelled by gravity and inertia alone, no communication equipment… but I am picking up… is that?” Communications Officer Stefan trailed off for a second, Silje cleared her throat as a polite reminder that the bridge was awaiting his analysis. “Captain… the object appears to be emitting sound waves, they’re very weak but there is some sort of speaker emitting sound into space”With that Communication Officer Stefan pressed a button and a crackled messaged began to play to the bridge.“Planet earth is blue - nothing - do” The messaged dropped out a few times, and seemed to be accompanied by a rhythmic droning that was hard to make out. The bridge grew quiet. Proof that humanity was still around was a good thing, but what they were now seeing on the observation screen didn’t quite make any sense. The object had continued on its course towards them and they could all now quite clearly see what it was. A humanoid figure in a crude looking atmosphere suit, sat in some sort of bright red control centre that opened directly into space. The control centre itself seemed oddly tacked onto what looked like some sort of small engine. A dim light radiated from one of the control panels in the red control centre, and reflected off visor of the oddly still humanoids atmosphere suit. A simple message.Don’t Panic. "
38,You are certain you have a stalker. You are also certain it isn’t human.,"It's late the slowly moving figure thinks as he is walking down the street. Walking from the bus stop to his home. The figure slows to a stop and turns looking behind him towards the direction he just came from. He hears something he is sure, a tiny bit of rustling, perhaps due to the slight wind that is beginning to pick up. Squinting into the darkness he waits. Waits for what he can not say. Something is out there hiding In the night. He stays quiet for a minute more. Nothing comes for him. Shaking off his unease he begins to walk again. He notes that the darkness is closing in. The street lamps that shined brightly just a minute ago have started to dim.Perhaps it is the darkness that has heightened his senses because he now can feel the monster he still cannot see. It's breath lashing at the back of his neck. He can feel his heart beat double as his body comes alive with a surge of adrenaline. He starts to run. Harder and faster then he ever has before. His arms pumping at his side. His legs smacking the asphalt and he tries push himself further. He can feel his breath fighting against itself as he tries to inhale and exhale simultaneously. It's gaining, he knows he is losing momentum, his body about to fail him.""No!"" He shouts as his foot comes down wrong and catches on a piece of uneven cement. He crashed hard as his body skids across the ground to a halt. A metallic taste floods his mouth. He spits out the blood and forcibly rolls himself over. If he is going to die he knew that he was going to go out facing that monster. Looking him in the eye as one last defiant moment. He raises himself up as best he can and shouts into the night. ""Come out coward!""The scent of honeysuckle hit his nose first followed by a light weight on his chest.She stood 4 inches from her green glad boots to the top of the golden crown she wore. Her wings,a nice shimmery silver, added width to an otherwise slender figure. ""Please sir I am lost can you help me?""His head smacked the ground as his body gave out. Laying there he began to cry.

40,"You successfully tricked everyone with your disguise. Problem is, you start to confuse which one is your true self.","I entered the goblin camp, with just on though in mind. Find out how many goblin are stationed at camp and find any weaknesses on the defenses.I got inside without any problems at all. They were all dancing around the bonfire. At least 50 of them. I hesitated, if they found out that I was a human spy, I'd be dead ASAP. A goblin came out behind me. *Shit, should I run?*.It pushed me, at first I though it wanted to fight me, later I realized that it just wanted me to join the *bonfire dance*. So, I did. At first I did not know what to do. Then I realized that there was not a specific set of moves to follow, one just had to go with the flow of the drums. So I danced, after a few minutes I began to like it. We danced for a couple of hours straight. It was exhausting.I met this young and nice goblin couple, with a goblin newborn. They seemed to take good care of it. The newborn doesn't seem as ugly as the rest of them.That's when I saw him. The goblin chief. Wielding a minotaur horn necklace, as a trophy and to show of its grandeur. *Know would be my chance to assassinate him, they'll kill me afterwards but it would plant enough chaos for my men to attack*, I hesitated. He walked right beside me and walked to the couple with the baby goblin. He gave the newborn a kiss on the forehead.I walked out of camp, unnoticed. I was meeting one my men to brief them. When I got to the meeting point I was attacked by a human. He tackled me, I hit the ground. He's on top of me, his arms on top of mine, I'm trapped. Can't get out.""Are you the general?"" -- He asked. *No idea what he's talking about*. -- ""Yes..."" -- I answered. He got off of me. Damn humans, I just hate them. They are so tall, they are everywhere and they believe that they can conquer whatever they please. Not *my* camp.""So, how big is the resistance?"" -- He asked. I get up, grab my dagger from my belt and stab him in the stomach. He seemed surprised, what did he expect? He attacked *me* first. Damn humans, where there is one, more are usually nearby, so I move silently, looking for any human camp. Found it, they are about 20 men stationed there. I go back to camp and inform the goblin chief about the camp location. He sent about 30 goblin to attack the camp. *We will be safe now, they'll get rid of the humans*.I just watched them leave to battle. *Am I...human?*. *What have I done?*. *Who...am I?*"
41,"You wake up with an app you didn't recall installing called ""Earth"". Within are a very specific & detailed interface with temperature, population, wildlife, etc. You mess around with it until you realize that the app is applying what you've changed on it to reality.","He woke up to a familiar buzzing from his phone. His small cupboard of a room could barely hold the mattress he slept on, as he was unreasonably tall. His white cardboard box he called a nightstand which was slightly off balance, and a singular lamp are all that made him what he is today. When he glanced at the phone, he noticed it wasn't his alarm making the buzz, but an app called ""Earth-chan"".Earth-chan, huh? Sure he wasn't all that into anime or anime tropes, but he was curious, and he found the meme in good taste so he opened it up. What stared at him was a still image of a girl in a white T-shirt with NASA as a sticker on the front, with hair that resembled the earth all around, like a globe.Wait, this wasn't a still image. The girl spoke.""Hiiiiii~""He threw the phone straight in front of him, smashing his only lamp. Before it even hit, he was under the covers of his tattered blanket, only fitting because he curled into a fetal position. The lamp breaking prompted his friend and roommate Greg to run into the room. Surviving in a low income African neighborhood for years before, Greg brought his bat along.""Matt! What the fuck!? Are you good man?""""Earth... but the... I thought...""Greg paused. He knew Matt was quick to get over what ailed him.""I heard this buzzing so I tapped it and there was this image of Earth-chan, and she... she spoke.""""...Earth-chan?""""The anime girl that gets weebs to stop littering.""""Oh yeah, I think I saw one of those."" Greg picked up the phone among the broken shards of glass.""Hiiiiii~"" said once again by the short anime girl.""I see..."" Greg said to no one as Matt walked up to him and the phone.""Is this some sort of AI?"" Matt pondered.""I don't know, but it's not that cree-""""I can hear you all, you know. So don't pretend I'm not here just because I'm so short! >:("" Earth-chan raised her voice.Greg and Matt jumped back.""I take that as a yes.""""So what are you doing here, Earth-chan?""""I don't know :3. I guess I just wanted someone to talk to...""Matt was a bit of a smartypants, and had an idea. ""Hold on, I have an idea. Earth-chan, twirl around for a bit."" He asked.""Ok! <3""As she twirled around, Matt and Greg took care to notice the window, which was almost blasted open by strong winds.""Interesting."" was all Matt could say, trying to keep a straight face.Greg was catching onto what Matt was thinking but couldn't believe it. Then he noticed a little black speck on Earth-chans hair. ""Hey Earth-chan, you got a little schmutz..."" He pointed to the spot on the head her schmutz was.""Oh! Woopsie! :) You're so attentive and caring, Greg-kun!""""Hey, how does she know our names??""""Contact list, silly! :P""""That's creepy, but makes sense. Hey, I'm getting a tweet. ...Uh, Matt? You may want to look at this.""Matt took his phone out of Gregs hand and looked at Gregs phone. The preview of the tweet read: Magnitude 9.9 earthquake hits New York, multiple buildings leveled, up to millions killed.""Uh oh..."" was all Greg could muster. The realization hit him like a bat to the head; Greg had killed millions by telling Earth-chan to fix her hair. He slowly sank to the ground, not knowing what else to do.""How are you doing, Matt-kun?"" Earth-chan said, without a care in the world, but she was ignored.Matt needed to do something quick to cheer up his friend and figure out how to fix this. ""Hey Greg... we don't know what we did. It was a mistake. And it hurts, really bad. But now we know. We can use Earth-chan here to make sure the world is safe! The meme may work! We have so much power in our hands, and from now on, we will use it only for good!"" It seemed to cheer Greg up a little.""Alright boys, I'm going to go take a shower. Bye-bye!"" Earth-chan said before leaving.""Wait, what?""""Oh shit...""""But if she's taking a shower, then that means... her hair...""Greg took the bat and smashed Matt's phone to pieces, only leaving random computer chips and bits of screen left. Matt wasn't that mad.""Did we do it in time?""""I think we'll know for sure soon."""
42,"You can erase memory of people you look at. One day you wake up in a room only lit by a candle. You realize that you forgot everything you ever knew. Next to you is a note reading:""Number 816, Male. First day.""","The ceiling is white. That, I know.The linen, the floor, the candles, everything white.My brain, too.That color of blinding light that pierces and becomes paralyzing, memory is a hazy thing that you struggle to recall, even the act of it.A white door opens from a wall. Odd, there were no creases there before hinting at an entrance. A man in a white lab coat comes in.“Let’s see here,” he says, “Patient 816, Male. Day one. How are you feeling, sir?”“I don’t know,” the words falling out from my lips as they move to shape them. “I don’t know,” I repeat in order to feel the way my lips move, creating each syllable as if automatic. How do I know how to do this?The man makes a mark on the clipboard he is carrying.“Mmhmm,” he says towards it. “Yes, yes. That’s par for the course.” looking towards me,“Do you know what that phrase means?”“I don’t know,” my lips now moving with more force as I become more apparent to them.“Golf term. Never really cared for the sport. Oh, yes, you have to be good at it if you want to play with the higher ups, but they never really tell you what good is, so what good does that do me.”“I. Don’t. Know,” I say.“Exactly! You catch my drift. Gah, I really have to stop using idioms with these guys.”“I…”“So, let me get to the point, that is, why you are here. You signed up for some experimental procedures, only, you didn’t really read the contract soo we injected you with this super secret formula that gave you the ability to erase people's memories when you look at them…” he takes in a big breath of air.“Don’t…” I feel out.“... and now you’re here because we still haven’t patched the mirror… situation.”“Know.”“Actually, it’s a yes. But I get it, a lot of people are in, like, super denial about it,” he says waving the clipboard in the air. “I mean, just be glad you’re number 816, you don’t want to know what happened to patient one!”“Don’t know.” I reply.“Yes, exactly!” he says. “Now let’s go into the next room where we can begin the rehabilitation process, and by the grace of God, you’ll be speaking normally in a year or so.”“God,” I repeat.“Oh no,” he says, “let’s not open that can of worms.”"
43,"You can erase memory of people you look at. One day you wake up in a room only lit by a candle. You realize that you forgot everything you ever knew. Next to you is a note reading:""Number 816, Male. First day.""","The only thing I knew about myself was that I had a unique skill. Though I couldn't quite remember what it was. When I saw the note that said ""Number 816, Male. First Day."" It hit me: I had become a victim of my own ability to erase people's memories. All the irony that morning felt like sludge in my brain. I immediately took stock of my physical health -- I felt fine. All my fingers and toes wiggled, and I wasn't particular stiff so I couldn't have been there for more than an evening. The person responsible for my predicament might still be there. ""Hello?"" I shouted, only to hear my own voice echo in the paint of the walls. I looked around for more clues. There's a candle. Interesting choice for illumination because it doubles as a clock. By the looks of it, it's only been five to seven hours. Why do I know that? In the corner I see a notepad. I kneel toward it and reach as if my ankle is shackled to the cot I just crawled from. I flip it open to the first page and, to my glee, there's a message. -Your first thought-Your first emotion-Your immediate observations-Everything you know about yourself*I proceeded to write what was requested of me, whilst considering the significance of the first emotion I had when I awoke. Hmm, confusion... isn't an emotion. Wonder? Good lord, was I excited? I checked the second page. I looked at the third page. I looked at the fourth page.Good luck. ~Y*What does 'Y' stand for? Yogi Bear? Yourself? "
44,"Aliens come to Earth from all across the galaxy to establish trade. This is because Earth has an abundance of a rare plant used in high class restaurants of alien worlds, the Ancient Rejuvenation Herb or as we call it 'Weed'.","“Dude, like, who are you? Did someone lace my herb? Shiiit,” Randy said, extremely stoned, walking the streets of his Los Angeles neighborhood, with two strange humanoids standing in front of him.“Human, we are here to trade. We desire this Ancient Rejuvenation Herb.”“What? Hell no am I giving you my weed. I paid like 20 bucks for this. This is good kush!”“We will offer you one million Aterian Credits for the Herb.”“How much is that in dollars?”“It is about...$67.39 USD. It is a fair exchange, is it not?”“It isn’t! Now get the hell out of my fuckin’ way, I gotta get to Taco Bell. I’m getting the munchies.”The Aterians pull out a ray weapon, “I would not do that, human. You would be making a grave error. Just give us the Herb and we will be on our way.”“I’ve already told you, man. I’m not givin’ you my weed!”The Aterians fire the ray weapon by Randy’s feet. “We do not play games, human. Now give us the Herb, or prepare for vaporization.”“Ok, fine, Jesus Christ. Fuckin’ freaks,” Randy swore. “I mean, maybe I can buy some decent weed with this.” And he caught his bus to Chinatown."
45,"A genetic test was found that reliably predicts sociopathic behavior at near 100%. The average of society has an incidence rate of approximately 0.4%. Politicians, however, tested at near 50% incidence, and already strained public opinion reaches its breaking point.","""Please, so what if I got 75% on the psychometer, I could get a 90% on the sociopath detector and people would still vote for me over you!"" laughed the democrat nominee at the 2020 presidential debate, ""three reasons why: #1 I'm tough on guns, tough on Russians, and tough on crime. #2 I will bring the jobs back not through trickle down economics, but through expanding government jobs, bringing more police into the force to protect schools, and #3 look at these huuuge, muscular hands."" The sea of blue hats whooped and cheered ""Make America Greater!"" ""Make America Greater!""  A new sociopath was in town, bigglier and more outrageous than the president elect could wish to be. At first it was a bummer to find out that Tom Hanks of all people, had turned out to be a psycho, but at this point people had reached their breaking point. With politicians often 50% over the prick-tor scale and even girl scouts often failing the test (no surprise, those little monsters would sell a box of sugar to a diabetic to make $4), Americans just didn't care anymore. Maybe it was violent tv or video games or fluoride in the water, who knows why so many people were coming up F.U.-positive. Even political sides and issues didn't matter anymore. Americans knew nothing was going to change.  What really mattered was this guy had a butter smooth voice, kind fatherly overtones, and promised to delete his twitter account if elected.edit: Grammar and a poor attempt to make it a bit more politically neutral. Sorry if I offend anyone's beliefs, the prompt says both sides are equally sociopathic.  "
46,When we die we’re reincarnated to another planet. There’s an error and you remember your previous life on earth,"I've always thought since I was a child that maybe we all lived different lives before. Today, all the signs showed itself. I met my wife from my previous life. The moment I met her, I instantly recalled all the experiences that I had in my previous life in a different planet, as a different race. There is a feeling of knowing, that this is real and I couldn't have made all of this up. Perhaps there really is a bond that transcends time and space after all.  "
