{"Never tell a human they CANT do something. They seem to take it as a challenge EVERY TIME!\n": ["When Man was born, Nature said to him, \"You are weak. You have not claws to fight danger, nor fangs to slay your prey, nor fur to weather the cold. You cannot compete with the bear, the saber-tooth, the mammoth.\"\nSo Man slew the bear and severed its claws, slew the saber-tooth and stole its fangs, and slew the mammoth and claimed its fur. And Man took these for himself, and grew stronger.\nThen Nature said to Man, \"You are stronger, but not enough. You are blind in the darkest of nights, yet you cannot steal the eyes of the beasts.\"\nSo Man took flint and struck it against stone, and created fire. With that he no longer feared the night, and he grew stronger.\nNature said to Man, \"You are stronger, yet still weak. You are disorganized, chaotic, vulnerable. You will surely succumb to the if you remain alone.\"\nSo Man drew symbols and created words, and built himself languages. And with those he created civilizations, tens of thousands working towards a common goal, and he grew stronger.\nNature said to Man, \"You are stronger, but far from perfect. You still have nothing but your two hands, and you will build nothing with those hands.\"\nSo Man harnessed fire and lightning and built monsters of wood and iron. And these monsters took on the tasks of Man, and Man grew stronger.\nNature said to Man, \"You are stronger, though still lacking. You are stranded on this planet of earth and water. You will never reach the stars above.\"\nSo Man built himself a new beast, a long spear of steel that spewed fire and carried him into the sky. He reached the pale moon that was once only a distant dream, and claimed it as his own, and he grew stronger.\nAnd at last, Nature said to Man, \"You have conquered my trials and grown stronger, but you will never conquer yourself. You are violent and selfish. You kill your brothers and sisters, and bring ruin to the land of your ancestors. You create weapons that would destroy the world ten times over, and praise those who would gladly use them. You are headed towards ruin, and there is nothing you can do.\"\nSo once again, Man fought back.\nI've been sitting on this idea for a while. I had originally intended to post this in /r/hfy at some point, but this works too. \nAlso, if you enjoyed this, you may be interested in my other stories at /r/jwfiredragonwrites.\n"]}
