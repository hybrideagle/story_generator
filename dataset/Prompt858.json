{"You are certain you have a stalker. You are also certain it isn\u2019t human.\n": ["It's late the slowly moving figure thinks as he is walking down the street. Walking from the bus stop to his home. The figure slows to a stop and turns looking behind him towards the direction he just came from. He hears something he is sure, a tiny bit of rustling, perhaps due to the slight wind that is beginning to pick up. Squinting into the darkness he waits. Waits for what he can not say. Something is out there hiding In the night. He stays quiet for a minute more. Nothing comes for him. Shaking off his unease he begins to walk again. He notes that the darkness is closing in. The street lamps that shined brightly just a minute ago have started to dim.\nPerhaps it is the darkness that has heightened his senses because he now can feel the monster he still cannot see. It's breath lashing at the back of his neck. He can feel his heart beat double as his body comes alive with a surge of adrenaline. He starts to run. Harder and faster then he ever has before. His arms pumping at his side. His legs smacking the asphalt and he tries push himself further. He can feel his breath fighting against itself as he tries to inhale and exhale simultaneously. It's gaining, he knows he is losing momentum, his body about to fail him.\n\"No!\" He shouts as his foot comes down wrong and catches on a piece of uneven cement. He crashed hard as his body skids across the ground to a halt. A metallic taste floods his mouth. He spits out the blood and forcibly rolls himself over. If he is going to die he knew that he was going to go out facing that monster. Looking him in the eye as one last defiant moment. He raises himself up as best he can and shouts into the night. \"Come out coward!\"\nThe scent of honeysuckle hit his nose first followed by a light weight on his chest.\nShe stood 4 inches from her green glad boots to the top of the golden crown she wore. Her wings,a nice shimmery silver, added width to an otherwise slender figure. \"Please sir I am lost can you help me?\"\nHis head smacked the ground as his body gave out. Laying there he began to cry. \"Oh why couldn't it have been a vampire. Such a less painful way to go!\"\n"]}
