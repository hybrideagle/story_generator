{"God has a cell phone and is really bad at following up on text messages\n": ["Sam kneels down at the foot of his bed. A zealous and erudite man, he had belonged to Gods flock all his life. Recently, however, the devil had found its way into his heart. A vice like grip was now held over him. Gambling. He could not stop. His finances quickly melting away as his relationship with God wavered. He knelt before the grace of God, determined to bring it to an end. He clasps his hands together in prayer.  \n\"Lord, I have fallen away from your light. The devil consumes my soul with an addiction I cannot fight. Help give me the strength to fight this. Have mercy on me and wash away my sins. Give me a sign. With your glory, I hope to defeat this.\" \nStanding up, Sam looks out of his window into the morning sky. This new strife has rocked to his very core. For the first time he finds himself unsure if God is really listening, or if he even exists. Suddenly, the clouds whiz across the sky, forming giant fluffy letters as they fuse together. Sam feels his faith ignited within him once more. Truly, a wondrous act of God was befalling his very eyes. He watched as the clouds turned into letters, reading out the holy inscription that formed in the sky. \n"]}
