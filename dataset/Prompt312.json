{"In a world where Elves, Dwarwes, Humans and other being live, you're a unique being. A sentient, highly magical fungus.\n": ["&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nHmmmm~\nI love this time of the year. It's so nice to be able to spread your mycelium all over the ground while eating the fallen leaves. Not like in the summer when everything is so alive and resisting. I prefer having free food. \nIt's been so good lately that I've even been getting mushrooms! It feels so good when something touches it. Just having the wind come by and..\nAaaaaah~\nThe wind is being so generous today. Please wind, please give me more! Yes! Yes that's it! Just keep going like that! \nYeeeeeeeeees~\nLife is truly good here in the forest. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe dwarf approached the fence first, followed by an entourage of other humanoids. Some big, some small, some looking like they don't want to be there but most looking around and taking pictures on their Stasis Projection orbs, SPorbs for short. They all formed a half circle around the dwarf, looking at and over him as the harsh winds blew over their faces. \n\"And this 'ere is the source of all the wind in Ventus Forest. It's called the Amanita Ventana. It's a magic mushroom that keeps itself high. Heh heh heh..\"\nThe silence continued as the crowd either looked at him in confusion or was struck silent by the awful joke.\nSeeing this reaction, he switched over to a monotone voice as if he started reciting: \"The Amanita Ventana is one of the few rare magic funghi that exist on Astera. It creates these winds using magic to help it spread its spores. The characteristic blue glow is a result of the magic stored inside it. It is thought to have self awareness, but since sentient mushrooms are so rare, nobody knows how it expresses itself let alone communicate.\"\nAn amalgamation of ooohs and aaahs erupts from the crowd, with the occasional curious hmmm. The SPorbs start flashing like usual and the group moves on to the next attraction. \nIn one last attempt the dwarf says: \"Ya might never know, perhaps it's trying to talk to us, but it might as well be jacking off. We'll never know! Whahahaha..\"\nOnce again the crowd stayed silent.\n", "The distant humming awoke me from my slumber, the memories of the surrounding  land infusing themselves into me as I sprang from the ground.\nMy hands pierced the hard packed dirt, clasping themselves firmly together as my sinuous body corkscrewed itself out of the ground. A churning whirlwind of dust and decayed matter accompanied my exit from the warm embrace of the earth.\nI will miss that embrace, I thought, as I pulled myself from the ground. Shaking the last remnants of debris off, I looked down to check my body.\nThe fibers of my being shined with the moonlight, a slow and pulsing green of noxious earthen energy. It was volatile and begging to be released, surging through my arms and ascending the dust around my feet. The small whirlwind coated the fibers in a layer of hard clay armor.\n\u201cNow where am I?\u201d I asked aloud to the barren land. \nPlacing my hand to the ground, a focused wave of encroaching energy was spread out to assess information from the local flora. \nThe feeling was exhilarating every time, it never got old. The amount of information I was able to access at a moments notice. It made the job easy for sure.\nThe green wave of energy rushed back to my fingertips like a frightened fox, the coalesced energy on my fingertips seemingly excited to return with its bounty. I swallow the information, literally, ingesting information the way a mushroom knows how.\nThe taste of blood, of mixed origins. Humans...their distinct cosmetics and overbearing hygiene overpowering the normally bland taste of their blood. \n\u201cThe animals.\u201d I declared with a smug disinterest, waving away their pestilent thought with a caress of my jaw. \nIs that...dwarven blood? The diminutive sub-humans never left their subterranean homes, much less their mines and mountains. What was the blood of one doing here?\nOld War and magic were the lasting aftertaste of the energy. \nThe fibers of my calves tensed in reflex at the overbearing realization. A quick scan of the land in front of me revealed a small oasis. A small patch of flourishing forest thrived in this large and barren tundra. A quick shuffle of memory accessed information that this land was always a tundra. An anomaly sat under the oasis, the source of its continued survival.\nAn elf woman buried with a congealed magic crystal, encased in a dwarven coffin of the finest make the funneling the crystals energy into the oasis.\nI sigh at my duties. As much as I love to see life flourish, my existence was to preserve the natural balance. This magic...making this land flourish was not natural.\n\u201cFocus. One day I will return the life that I have smothered this day.\u201d I said to myself and as a promise to the budding oasis.\nPalms to the ground, the energy within shifted from its vibrant and slow green to the rich browns of earth, a landslide hurtling towards the oasis.\nThe scene never got less exhilarating, yet it carved a wound just as deep every time. \n\u201cExcuse my wound mother, I will heal it in time.\u201d I say, kneeling to the ground. A single tear streamed down my fibrous face.\nIt consumed the oasis in a hurried rush of decay. The trees ran their entire lifetime in a moments notice, leaves and seeds falling and shriveling to dust on the way to the ground, wiping their existence away. The small birds and insects simply ceased being, mere shells of themselves before being carried away by the tide of energy. The small pond within was the last to part, it\u2019s waters filled with a high concentration of magic.\nThe swirling wave decay rose high above the small mass of water, a colossal python of decaying energy set to strike upon the depths of the waters at the crystal.\nIt plunged.\nThe water was a hard defense, a shifting mass of solid, transparent material. Durable enough to stand war machines and high concentrations of mages working together.\n\u201cMother, lend me your strength.\u201d I asked absently, setting loose a focused stream of vibrant green energy among the tides, it coming to a rest as it shone inside the head of the decaying energy.\nThe head plunged into the waters as it dig into the funnel, snuffing out the crystals energy and causing the dwarven coffin to rust into nothing more than a few bolts and a sturdy frame.\n\u201cThese dwarves are getting more meticulous with their crafts. Soon, I suspect none can stop them.\u201d I said with a hearty laugh as I willed the tides of energy back to me.\nIt rushed back to my body like a salmon to the breeding grounds. The head of the brown energy struck my hand and I winced as I relived the death of every single organism with that oasis.\nA sigh of relief. \u201cSometimes I hate my job.\u201d I say, sitting back down on the hard dirt I sprouted from.\nWhere the oasis once was, stood a patch of green grass no more than a foot high.\nI smiled in content. \u201cAt least I have command over my power, these humans and elves let theirs run rampant. The imbeciles, if they only knew how to ask for help.\u201d I laughed as I struck the ground with a closed fist.\nThe ground swallowed me once again, as I lay in wait for the next anomaly upon the land to spring up. \n", "The moving creatures have been at war for 100 sun cycles, but they all seem to be fighting for similar reasons. \nThe creatures with the pointy things on the sides of their heads say they were here first. \nBut the small creatures with the beards say their ore mines pre-date any civilization.  The third group of creatures is a curious one. They look like a mixture of the other two groups. \nBut they don\u2019t care who arrived first.  All they care about is power and conquest. \nOr so we thought. \nSymbiosis is the nature of the universe. \nRelationships between lifeforms can form the foundation that holds ecosystems together or create the mayhem that tears them apart. \nMillions of sun cycles ago, our planet exploded, sending pieces of molten rock cascading across the galaxy. While the destruction of our home forced millions of lifeforms into extinction, \nit also created the potential for intergalactic travel. \nOur species survived tucked away in the deep holes of our planet\u2019s crust. The large pieces of rock sent flying acted as our vessels, and we landed with a furious crash upon where we now reside. \nLike our planet\u2019s destruction, our arrival also forced more lifeforms into extinction. \nOur vessels penetrated into the planet\u2019s skin, sending clouds of dust and ash into the air. The sun was blocked for what felt like millennia. Everything that breathed oxygen or needed the sun to survive died. \nBut life is resilient.\nIt took millions of sun cycles for the toughest life forms to begin their evolution. From bacteria to amoeba and beyond, our species has witnessed the death and growth of life on this planet. \nOur spores and family have spread across every region, touching every ecosystem. We use each other to communicate, to feel vibrations, and to influence our environment positively.  \nWe can see everything. We know everything. And it is time for the moving creatures to stop fighting.  \nConsciousness is a confusing power. The moving creatures, with all their aspirations and technology, have forgotten their origins. They have forgotten that their histories are inexplicably linked. \nThey must be re-wired. And the only way to do that is from the inside. \nWe always grew and existed in the shadows. The dark, moist sections of the earth \u2014 our sanctuaries. But now, we needed to reveal ourselves and integrate our understanding into the collective consciousness. \nWe sent out spores to grow on sticks floating down streams. We attached ourselves to leaves ready to be carried away by the wind. We spread across the planet, each year becoming more visible and enticing to the moving creatures. \nThen we were eaten. \nThe group that looked like a mixture of the short ones and the ones with pointy ears, were the first to consume our kind. \nTheir shamans and explorers harvested our bodies and brought back large quantities of our flesh to use in their special ceremonies. Slowly, more and more of their kind consumed our kind. \nAnd their motivations began to change. \nOur composition means even being consumed is an act of symbiosis. The moving creatures receive sustenance and stimulation, we receive a new host to call home. \nOnce digested, we begin to integrate with the brains of our new hosts. And slowly over time, we can change the way an entire species thinks. \nThe moving creatures gained access to our understanding of the planet, and we gained access to the collective consciousness and power of the moving creatures. \nWith that. a new age of humanity dawned. \nWith our new symbiotic understanding, we now could classify the moving creatures. The humans, as they call themselves, have set out to mend the rifts between what they call, \u201cElves\u201d and \u201cDwarves.\u201d \nConquest is no longer their objective, but to learn the origins of their species through the understanding of two much older civilizations. \nLittle do they know, they have more common with the Elves and Dwarves than they could ever imagine. \n"]}
