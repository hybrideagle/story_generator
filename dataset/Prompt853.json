{"Changing a Wikipedia article will actually change reality to match what was written. Only the people who edit Wikipedia actually seem to notice this.\n": ["Are you aware of the Mandela effect? The conspiracy theory that when you think something is one way that you remembered, but was something far different? It got its name from the memory people had when Nelson Mandela was thought dead after his activism in Africa, while he was in fact alive and in prison? Maybe you know of it as the Berenstain Bears, where people remembered it as the Berenstein Bears? You can thank Wikipedia of all things for that.\nIt started one day when an editor for a Wikipedia decided to be an internet troll and edit President Donald Trump's page to include a few paragraphs to include his death at the hands of...Sonic the Hedgehog. Someone had warped reality by inserting a fictional blue hedgehog into our world, and gave him the motive to assassinate our president. I would cringe at the idea, but I can't press myself to do so in current circumstances. I'll get to that later.\nOnce someone edited out these events, undoing the death of Trump, more editors started finding that errors such as Mandela's death or the spelling of the Berenstain Bears were making reality shift more and more, and we had to police ourselves more before the public would catch on, if they ever would. That means we couldn't force the death of Hitler before the Holocaust, that we couldn't force the existence of the cure for cancer, these things had to and have to happen naturally or else history and reality will be fractured.\nOur efforts to keep the world intact while updating and editing Wikipedia have been proven fruitless, however, once user fartbutts420 made their way into the Wikipedia editing community. fartbutts420 was a sociopath, cynical and uncaring to the core, and we are all paying the price. It is due to their edits that our world is blinking out of existence in thirty minutes, and that we are unable to stop it, as prophesized in their article, End of the World. We cannot edit or remove their work, and we cannot write anything to save our world. I'm writing this in the hopes it could somehow, someway, reach someone in another plane of existence to save them. \nPlease, do not misuse Wikipedia.\n", "I heard the rumours, but the voice of reason in my head knew better. That didn\u2019t, however, stop the temptation to edit a Wikipedia page. \nIt was pretty easy to pick a page. I mean, the US has just experienced of its most peaceful and prosperous year in history. So I thought I could get a good laugh by changing a very obvious and clear fact. It helped that I had been a trusted editor in Wikipedia for a few years. I mean, who else was going to stop the pranksters from editing my school\u2019s page?\nBut I didn\u2019t realise it would lead to this. You, the reader, you won\u2019t believe me. But you\u2019ve got to try. You see, my mess up extended further than a single page. I think that because it was a such a huge change, larger portions of reality changed with it to fit the narrative. How could I have known? I\u2019m just a college student!\nBut it\u2019s too late now. But not too late for you to try spread my story. To warn others of the danger. Please, you have to. I might have deprived the world of a better future, but you can maybe change it if you co-ordinate. You can see my mistake, my horrible mishap [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) . \nOf course you can see it elsewhere, by that is where it began. And now for at least another three years, that idiot will be smiling back at me on that page.\n"]}
