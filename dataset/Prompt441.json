{"You die and go to Heaven, only to find out that your lover was sent to Hell. You beg God to take pity, but it's actually Satan that hears you.\n": ["\"Please, there has to be something you can do! She really was a good person.\" God looked at me with pity but just shook his head \"I'm sorry son, she didn't make the cut, there has to be rules.\" How could this be heaven if Samantha wasn't here with me, we had been together 17 years before the accident happened. \"Get some sleep my child, you've had a long day. You'll like it here.\" \nGod had an angel show me to my new house and of course it was everything I'd ever dreamed of. After the angel left the phone rang, who could be calling, I literally just got here. \"Hello?\" \n\"Jonathan! Hi, uhm, so, I don't usually do things like this but you seem pretty nice and all and God, I mean he's kinda a dick huh?\" \n\"Uhm, who is this?\"\n\"Oh ya, sorry, it's Lucifer.\" \n\"Like, THE Lucifer, the Devil?\"\n\"Ya, king of darkness, all that jazz. Let's just skip over that for now, I have your wife here and I was kinda eavesdropping on your little talk with God and I think we came up with a solution for everyone.\" \"Uh, ya, alright, what's going on?\" \n\"You can come be down here with your wife whenever you want and there's just one small thing I need from you.\" \"Yes, anything!!\" \n\"I need an assistant and I hear you're really good at Excel.\"\n", "\"You... you must be mistaken.\"\n\"I'm afraid not.\"\n\"She... there's no way she was a killer.\"\n\"It's no surprise you don't know. It was before she met you.\" God explained, flipping through her file. \"In her early twenties, she was extremely mysandristic, and killed 27 young men. After five years, the police started to catch on, and she fled the region, going nearly half the distance it takes to get from one US coast to the other. You met her about a year later.\"\nI cradled my head and leaned forward.\n\"It may comfort you to know she wasn't a sociopath. She did love you, and she was sorry for what she did, eventually. But she never did turn herself in.\"\n\"But I... I'm never gonna see her again?\"\n\"Well-\"\nThe door to the office burst open. \"Not hardly.\" Said a firm voice, tinged with rage. I turned to see a handsome, middle-aged man in a well-tailored suit carrying a briefcase. He seemed quite frustrated, but when he laid his eyes on me his gaze softened and he smiled.\nHe strode up to the desk, then turned to me, and with a short bow, offered out his hand. \"Mr. Bishop, I presume?\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Lucifer, pleased to meet your acquaintance. I'll be representing you and your wife.\" He sat down in the arm chair beside me, giving an even shorter bow as he did so. \"Good day, Father.\" He said simply and quietly.\nGod furrowed his brow. \"And to you. What brings you here?\"\n\"Well it seems me and my associates have been misinformed as to the situation regarding Mrs. Bishop.\"\n\"Misinformed?\"\n\"Yes. In fact, we were led to believe she was an unrepentant sociopath. No one was even told she had a spouse.\"\n\"Well, I think that hardly changes the situation.\"\n\"I-I'm confused...\" I finally spoke out. \n\"Right.\" Lucifer responded, crossing his legs. \"You see, no one stays in hell forever. It's all temporary. Even Hitler will eventually get out.\"\n\"*Hitler*?\"\n\"*Eventually*.\" He pulled a pad of paper and pen from his breast pocket, and began scribbling some figures. \"You see, the suffering is to make people understand the pain they've caused, and to help them truly feel sorry. Various factors play in to how long someone will stay, and coming from different living situations can make their suffering impact them more, or less.\" He look up from the pad. \"So tell me, your wife died 23 years before you, correct?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"And you were together until then?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Any talk of divorce or fights?\"\n\"No, never.\"\n\"Did you become involved with anyone else after her death?\" \n\"Never even dreamt of it.\" God was growing increasingly impatient.\n\"Being separated from a close lover can decrease time spent in Hell greatly. Did she ever do any charity?\"\n\"Yeah, she made monthly donations to male rape victim support groups.\"\n\"This contradicts her greatest sins in life, implying, if not confirming, that she repented during her life, also greatly diminishing the time she should've spent.\"\nGod sighed in frustration. \"How much time does she have left?\"\n\"Well, an unrepentant murderer would normally have QUITE a lot longer to serve. But if we add up her emotions, her happy marriage, her efforts to repent during life...\" Lucifer drew a line then took a few seconds to write the final figure, then he frowned. \"Oh look, it would seem *we owe her time*,\" Lucifer said through clenched teeth, and turned the pad to show the results to God. \nThe paper was covered in a mixture of recognizable, albeit it complex, math, and strange symbols. But the results at the bottom were clear; -3 years.\n\"I believe we're done here.\" Lucifer stood.\n\"So... my wife is going to be released?\"\n\"Immediately, Mr. Bishop. Unfortunately, there's nothing to be done about the time owed to you two.\" He turned back to God. \"As for you, Father, you *must* send me the *entire* file from now on.\"\nGod gave another sigh. \"If you insist...\"\nLucifer beckoned me to follow him out of the room, and I did.\n\"Why is he like that?\" I asked as we walked down the wide, white hallway.\n\"My father likes punishing evildoers a little too much. He also has several trillion cases to go through, so he doesn't like to sweat over the details.\"\nWe reached the front office, and sitting in one of the chairs was my wife.\n\"Lewis?\" She stood up, her eyes wide in disbelief.\n\"Emily!\" I ran over to her and hugged her.\n\"Lewis! I... I'm so sorry I never told you...\" She sniffled.\n\"Shh, it's ok, it's gonna be ok.\" I pressed my face into her hair, taking in everything about her for the first time in what felt like an eternity. Finally I pried myself away to turn to Lucifer. \"Thank you so much for your help.\"\nLucifer smiled and simply said \"Anytime,\" before leaving the office.\n"]}
