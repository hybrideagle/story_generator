{"You can erase memory of people you look at. One day you wake up in a room only lit by a candle. You realize that you forgot everything you ever knew. Next to you is a note reading:\"Number 816, Male. First day.\"\n": ["The ceiling is white. That, I know.\nThe linen, the floor, the candles, everything white.\nMy brain, too.That color of blinding light that pierces and becomes paralyzing, memory is a hazy thing that you struggle to recall, even the act of it.\nA white door opens from a wall. Odd, there were no creases there before hinting at an entrance. A man in a white lab coat comes in.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see here,\u201d he says, \u201cPatient 816, Male. Day one. How are you feeling, sir?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the words falling out from my lips as they move to shape them. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I repeat in order to feel the way my lips move, creating each syllable as if automatic. How do I know how to do this?\nThe man makes a mark on the clipboard he is carrying.\n\u201cMmhmm,\u201d he says towards it. \u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s par for the course.\u201d looking towards me,\u201cDo you know what that phrase means?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d my lips now moving with more force as I become more apparent to them.\n\u201cGolf term. Never really cared for the sport. Oh, yes, you have to be good at it if you want to play with the higher ups, but they never really tell you what good is, so what good does that do me.\u201d\n\u201cI. Don\u2019t. Know,\u201d I say.\n\u201cExactly! You catch my drift. Gah, I really have to stop using idioms with these guys.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo, let me get to the point, that is, why you are here. You signed up for some experimental procedures, only, you didn\u2019t really read the contract soo we injected you with this super secret formula that gave you the ability to erase people's memories when you look at them\u2026\u201d he takes in a big breath of air.\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d I feel out.\n\u201c... and now you\u2019re here because we still haven\u2019t patched the mirror\u2026 situation.\u201d\n\u201cKnow.\u201d\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s a yes. But I get it, a lot of people are in, like, super denial about it,\u201d he says waving the clipboard in the air. \u201cI mean, just be glad you\u2019re number 816, you don\u2019t want to know what happened to patient one!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d I reply.\n\u201cYes, exactly!\u201d he says. \u201cNow let\u2019s go into the next room where we can begin the rehabilitation process, and by the grace of God, you\u2019ll be speaking normally in a year or so.\u201d\n\u201cGod,\u201d I repeat.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d he says, \u201clet\u2019s not open that can of worms.\u201d\n", "The only thing I knew about myself was that I had a unique skill. Though I couldn't quite remember what it was. When I saw the note that said \"Number 816, Male. First Day.\" It hit me: I had become a victim of my own ability to erase people's memories. All the irony that morning felt like sludge in my brain. \nI immediately took stock of my physical health -- I felt fine. All my fingers and toes wiggled, and I wasn't particular stiff so I couldn't have been there for more than an evening. The person responsible for my predicament might still be there. \n\"Hello?\" I shouted, only to hear my own voice echo in the paint of the walls. \nI looked around for more clues. There's a candle. Interesting choice for illumination because it doubles as a clock. By the looks of it, it's only been five to seven hours. Why do I know that? \nIn the corner I see a notepad. I kneel toward it and reach as if my ankle is shackled to the cot I just crawled from. I flip it open to the first page and, to my glee, there's a message. \n-Your first thought\n-Your first emotion\n-Your immediate observations\n-Everything you know about yourself*\nI proceeded to write what was requested of me, whilst considering the significance of the first emotion I had when I awoke. Hmm, confusion... isn't an emotion. Wonder? Good lord, was I excited? \nI checked the second page. \nI looked at the third page. \nI looked at the fourth page.\nGood luck. \n~Y*\nWhat does 'Y' stand for? Yogi Bear? \nYourself? \n"]}
