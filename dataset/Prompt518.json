{"Dragons can't use magic, making picking up small objects (like coins) rather difficult.\n": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/80y0ga/wp_dragons_cant_use_magic_making_picking_up_small/\nFor Frederick, every night was a chore. He spent the better part of two hours sweating and cursing under his fiery breath.\n\"What're you muttering about again, old lizard?\" a voice as pleasant as the sound of a mosquito in a tent inquired. \"Need any help?\"\n\"Piss off, I'm just find on my own thank you. No need for your sticky fingers to magically turn pounds into pennies you bat-eared freak!\"\nThe inquirers ears were indeed bat-like: perpendicular to his skull and almost perfectly round. Between them, a sly, mocking grin spread wide across bluish shoe-string lips. A pair of small, beady eyes inspected the coin purse that was the object of Frederick's misery.\n\"Struck a chord, there, old chum?\"\nIt was impossible to tell which chin began shaking first as the rotund figure emitted a wheezing belly-laugh at Frederick's irritation.\n\"What do you want, Belfort?\"\nA small, angry flame flicked out of Frederick's mouth as he painstakingly counted his pennies. Though a dragon he was, Frederick's upper extremities more closely resembled forks than forearms, which made counting coins rather difficult. Indeed, he had to push his head far to the front and nearly lay it down to be able to reach the ground. Belfort performed a small dance around the lizard's moneybag.\n\"Oh, nothing, just offering to help an old friend. Say, Frederick, have you ever considered getting a job?\"\nFrederick stopped counting. He raised his head, easily the size of Belfort's entire body and studded with horns, and pointed one eye at his portly interlocutor. Red and yellow, with a vertical slit down the middle, much like that of a cat. Or a lizard.\n\"Don't you think, I've tried, Belfort? Nobody needs dragons these days. There are no princesses to keep locked up in towers anymore, and not for want of princesses. They just don't do that sort of thing anymore. Every since Palmyra, Princess of Dunderland and heiress to King Wubblebum's fortune escaped her tower -- you know, the one guarded by Steve -- and told the press it was all a racket to generate donations for the White Knights Order, the market's completely gone down the tubes. The town criers gassed on about it for weeks! And all because Palmyra didn't get what she thought was a fair cut of the kickbacks! Greedy bastards, the lot of them...\"\nBelfort's grin receded into a thoughtful pout, as the fat, hairless dwarf rubbed his chin. Frederick returned to counting his coins.\n\"What about getting into the transportation business, Frederick? Surely you could take to the skies with a gaggle of gullible tourists on your back?\"\n\"Nobody trusts a dragon anymore, Belfort. It's a miracle people have the charity to give me their alms every day,\" the dragon paused as he dropped the last coin into a small, wooden box hanging from his neck between his arms. \"There. Thirty-one pounds and twelve pence, Belfort. Today has been a good day.\"\nBelfort smirked.\n\"Do you me to tell you how much I made in the last twelve hours?\"\n\"No,\" said Frederick, \"You're a conman and a thief. Even if I don't make much, I do it honestly.\"\nThe horizontally-challenged blob of pasty flesh that called itself 'Belfort' pursed its thin lips and blew a raspberry that echoed, like the quacking of a duck, under the Wilfred Bunt Memorial Bridge.\n"]}
