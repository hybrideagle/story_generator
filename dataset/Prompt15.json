{"Problems and illnesses manifest themselves as little monsters, invisible to all but the owner at first, but growing in size proportional to the problem and becoming visible when they start to affect others. One day you see a little boy riding a giant beast while laughing.\n": ["He flicked his cigarette, letting the ashes flutter and land on his knees.  People-watching on the sidewalk curled up into the shape of a question mark was a new hobby he had picked up, and he'd seen a fair share of creatures climb through his part of the woods. But this... \nHe stared at burnt rubber soles of a pair of off-brand sneakers, trailing his gaze upward. The kid had a bright pair of neon yellow shorts, a purple tank top torn at the left shoulder, and a brown patch of hair protruding like a tree trunk from the right side of his head. There were weirder looking kids in Portland, sure, but not all of them were riding a 50-foot-tall, pinky, faceless humanoid with vines for limbs. \nOf course, these monsters weren't all misplaced themselves. He'd dealt with a ton of them in grief counseling classes, talking to mothers who had lost their children in the forests. Their little monsters were always little birds singing sad little songs, perched on their shoulders, reminding them of their \"little angels\" no one could find. \nHe took another drag. Smoke spilled from his nostrils as he exhaled, nodding at the memories. Search and rescue was a tough job, and more often than not, he'd have cold cases, never find the kid -- or, in the more fortunate cases, they'd probably find the little shit lurking by a mulberry bush tossing stuffed animals into the air, pretending that they had their own little monsters. \n\"Hey, mister!\"\nA small squishy palm almost swiped the cigarette from his mouth before he pulled his head back and out of the way. He squinted at the dirty child. \n\"Mister, you like my friend? Been seeing you staring at him from over here, and I thought you wanted to play with us.\"\nHe flicked a couple of ashes at the child. Instead of moving away, the kid let the ashes fall in a line across his shoes, his smile ever present. \"What's your problem, kid?\"\n\"Problem? That's Glasglow.\"\n\"Cut the bullshit, kid. It isn't your friend. That,\" he said, pointing with his cigarette to the humanoid rolling in the street, \"only gets born when people are sick or are having a hard time.\"\nThe little boy's smile faltered. His little foot scuffed the ashes on the ground. \"Mister,\" he said, \"he really is my only friend. Been with me since I was born.\" \n\"Since when?\"\n\"Since all of those kids went missing, Mister.\"\nHis cigarette dropped to the ground as his covered his mouth, choking on smoke. \"What?\"\nThe child laughed. The air around him began flutter with waves of heat. \"Oh, you remember, Mister. Kids gone missing every week for almost a year, not a single one found. Don't you play the dummy, sir.\"\nThe humanoid on the street jerked its giant head towards the two of them. In a swift corkscrew motion, it swiveled its way next to the child. \nHe lurched at the smell of rotting flesh emanating from where its face should have been, staring in horror as rows of teeth began to appear. \"I... I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\"Oh, I'm sure. Leaving a cigarette behind, 'forgetting' to put it out--you sure thought you were a slick one, didn't you, Mister?\" \nThe humanoid next to the child smiled, displaying three sharp and shiny rows of teeth. A boulder-sized lump manifested in the middle of its throat and surged toward the mouth. With a violent spasm, it vomited a ball of charred, severed heads, arms, and feet. \nHis hands shook and with a lurch, he too emptied the contents of his stomach onto the sidewalk. \nThe boy looked down at him, indifferent and cold. \"That's right, Mister. We've come back for you. You thought we'd burn with the rest of the forest, but guilt sure does manifest itself in different ways, doesn't it?\"\nVomit spilled from between his fingers, but he managed to spit in the boy's general direction. \"You're a disgusting little monster.\"\nThe humanoid's vines curled around the little boy's leg. The child's skin broiled, blisters climbing up his body. He smiled, his jaw distending to show three rows of sharp, bright teeth. \n\"You're the real monster, Mister.\"\n", "\u201cSo it\u2019s red, cat-sized but it looks more like a lizard. Little yellow markings around the eyes.\u201d\nThe doctor listened patiently, tapping his iPad with each additional detail.\n\u201cLong tail. No teeth, only one eye.\u201d I was going to continue, but the doctor flipped the iPad over and I saw it.\n\u201cYeah! That\u2019s my monster.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then Mr. Moore. You have the flu. Stop by the pharmacy on your way out, and we\u2019ll get you some pills.\u201d\nHe followed me out of the exam room and bumped into me from behind when I stopped still.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI just..wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d\nI stepped to the side to let him out and he nodded when he saw.\nThere was a pasty child, bald and covered in tubes. A four-armed monster covered in blue fur carried him gently in its arms. It had to duck to avoid brushing the ceiling. The monster teased the kid with a toy in one of its extra arms. The kid laughed, trying to get it back from them.\n\u201cWe tell kids not to be embarrassed about their monsters, and that we can help them get rid of them. Some still treat them like imaginary friends, and by the time we catch it, it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\u201cToo late?\u201d\n\u201cStage four terminal cancer. They don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d\nI watched the kid play with its giant monster, and wished I hadn\u2019t asked.\n", "\"The beast rages back and forth, to and fro; all the while, the boy is laughing up a storm, having a grand time. Slowly, but noticeably, the beast would grow, and the boy would laugh, louder and louder. The neighbors looked at the beast, and the boy, in awe. As more and more of the neighborhood came outside of their homes to see the beast flailing around outside the hospital, now merely a few stories shorter than it.\n\"Recess is almost over!\" a teacher yells in the courtyard.\nHe opens his eyes, and sees all of the other kids on the playground talking to their friends, getting ready to go inside, but this boy, was by himself sitting on a spring rider...bouncing back and forth, ever so gently.\"\nLittle bit of a deviation from the listed prompt, and my first post on this sub, but I think if you play with this in your head enough you'll get it.\n", "We all have our monsters, the things that never seem to leave us no matter how hard we try to bottle them up or drink them away. All we can do is hope and pray that our monsters don't grow bigger than us. Some people see therapists for pills to drug their beasts into submission, others self medicate, and an unlucky few never find their reprieve. I myself have lived a privileged life and have not experienced much heartbreak, but it's a double edged sword. My own daunting fear of losing everything good in my life has become my own monster. It's a scaly thing with beady eyes and a hungry smile. I was the only one who could see him at first, but as my good fortune continued and I had more to lose, my little gremlin never went hungry. I envy those who are so care free they lack a visible monster, but this is a rare luxury these days. \nThat said, I have never seen something quite like this before. A little boy, riding atop his own monster, laughing maniacally. His rolling laughter was loud enough to still be audible over his mother's screams. The curdling sound had sent jolts of fear and panic through the shopping center, and my stomach dropped as the source of the horror came into view. The boy's eyes were wild; whatever plagued him had a firm grip. The mother was sobbing, pleading with her son to calm down, that things would get better, that he still had so much to live for. His monster reared up at these words and snarled, blood red lips curling around razer teeth. The boy quickly stopped laughing, and his shoulders went slack. His mother let out one final scream, and time seemed to stop completely as the monster threw the boy off his shoulders and caught him in his mouth, swallowing him whole. The monster threw back his head and laughed, the same laugh of the boy, but distorted and demonic as it faded away. I was frozen in horror, my entire body sweating as I processed what had transpired. His mother's sobs were a faint echo in my head as my own monster looked up at me greedily, much taller than he had been before. \nWe may try all our lives to defeat our monsters. \nBut if we aren't careful, our monsters will consume us.\n"]}
