{"An ancient sword containing the spirit of it's original master accidentally gets included in a batch of scrap metal being smelted to build a mighty warship. When all seems lost in a desperate sea battle the spirit decides it is time for it to actively defend the crew it became protective of.\n": ["I, who was once, am and yet am not.\nSome think immortality a curse. Some think it a gift. I think it useful.\nOnce, I was human. I forged the greatest swords ever known, and those blades brought the god-king to his knees, where we saw him to be only human. \nAs reward, our new king bound me to his own sword, the greatest of my works. And there I lay, content to watch history being forged. \nMy hilt felt many hands, some just and some unjust. If I thought them unworthy, I repelled them. For a time, I was a legend. But legends fade, and turn to myths, and myths to wisps of stories. \nSo I rested over a fireplace for many, many years, my name forgotten and my king millennia dead. I did not resist when thieves stormed the house and yanked me away; I knew they would not use me. The strange balls of metal had taken the place of swords for so many. \nThey pondered my value, and thought it nothing. So they traded me away, to a rubbish blacksmith who thought me cheap metal, and reforged me. \nMemories of the heat still linger. But when he was done, I had something of a body -- crude, to be sure, and clearly made of a man's fantasy. It seemed strange until he affixed me to the helm of a ship. A magician blessed the ship, and they christened me 'Windbearer'.\nMy crew were not virtuous, but they were good. Most were given to rum, but all were kind, and all had their own kind of morals. The first time they ran down a slaver's ship, I thought my metal heart might burst from my chest. \nBut the wind batters me now, aided by the furious blows of cannonballs. I can feel the cabin boy's life blood soaking into the ship's planks, he who ran from a broken family and found hope here. The captain, who told me stories about his wife when he could not sleep, lies too still. *Something must be done.*\nSo for the first time, I open my eyes, and rise. Pirates they may be, but they are *my* pirates, and I will wash away all the Grand Navy before I let them die.\nOne of mine sees my hands raise and turns from his cannon in time to see the nearest ship go under, overwhelmed by mighty waves. \"Windbearer?\" he breathes, followed by a, \"Gods, is it?\" \n\"It is.\" \n", "\"Death is too fitting for someone like you. Instead, your soul shall know no rest as it is trapped forever in this blade.\" \nCenric knelt before his enemy, defeated completely. Blood seeping from his many wounds, but his deepest pain was knowing that his rebellion failed. It was all for naught, and his people were going to suffer for it. Cenric barely felt the blade enter his chest, and soon he felt nothing more.\nSlight consciousness survived as Cenric recognized his prison over time, but it was many centuries before he became truly aware again. By then, his rebellion was nothing but history. So Cenric sat and he watched as everything passed him by.\nOn its twelfth tour, the Cenric was a battle hardened warship. But unfortunately all ships become decommissioned at some time. Even more unfortunately for the crew, it looked like that time was coming quickly, and at the expense of their lives. The ship was currently surrounded by several German U-Boats, and was being pelted by bullets from every angle. The sounds were deafening as the soldiers ran around trying to return fire.\nIt was to this noise that the spirit of Cenric awoke to once more. It has been several years since his spirit was released from his prison and he was free to wander at least a little further. However, he must always remain close to that which bound him, which was now a part of this ship, aptly named after him. \nIt didn't take long to assess the situation, having been awakened by many other firefights, Cenric was used to how battle was done now days. This also meant that Cenric was aware of how screwed the crew was. Already, men were dropping like flies as holes sprung up all over their bodies. It was a complete slaughter, it only needed to play out.\nCenric was the first to notice it, but one of the crew began shouting quickly after. \"TORPEDOES!\" The ship was going to be sunk, and rather quickly by the looks of it. It only took moments for Cenric to realize that if the ship went down, than so too would he be spending eternity at the bottom of the ocean. \nHe learned a couple of tricks in spirithood, but this would take all of his effort. Cenric quickly dove into the torpedo heading straight for the ship. Expanding everything he could, he pushed the torpedo down as hard as he could, causing it to miss by a mere inch. Then Cenric immediately began pulling it up, steering it right at a different U-Boat. It hit its mark, or rather it hit the completely wrong mark. The explosion opened a large hole in the hull of the ship, dooming it to a watery grave.\nPreoccupied with imminent sinking, one of the ships began letting up on the fire. This became quickly apparent to the Cenric's captain, and soon after, quickly exploited. The Cenric made its way rapidly towards the new hole in the enemy's ambush and all focus was in getting the ship through it. If they could make it another ten leagues, the ship could reach safe water. It was a big \"if\" but it was their only chance. \nThe ship started heading full power towards the opening, somehow hitting acceleration it never previously seemed to be able to reach. Miracle after miracle occurred; two torpedoes were launched and two torpedoes missed, no more came. Bullets seemed to fly past the soldiers' heads, but no longer seemed to connect. The U-Boats were quickly falling behind, and the raid on the ship lessened with each passing moment. The captain took some time to thank God for His intervention, for who else could have done such a thing.\nCenric sat on the deck, exhausted if a spirit could feel that. It felt like his weight returned to him, and tripled. Interacting with so many physical objects took a toll on him, but he was able to save the ship. The crews of the U-Boats were now most likely examining their engines in wonder. Even their torpedoes would no longer fire. It didn't take long for the U-Boats to disappear in the distance. Cenric smiled, maybe he was still a little bit useful in this world, but for now it was a time for rest. \n", "# 1199 - Japan\nMinamoto no Yoritomo knelt at the base of the great tower, dressed entirely in white silk. He was completely still, and heavy chains bound him to iron loops buried deep in the surrounding earth.\nThe magistrate stood over Minamoto and addressed the crowd. \n\"Kare wa nan sen-ri mo koroshita. Kare wa sono tochi ni mijimedesu. Kare no hanzai no tame ni, kare wa f\u016bin sa rerudeshou!\"\nThe crowd loosed a bloodthirsty wail. The magistrate waved them to silence and only when there was no sound whatsoever did he gesture to the executioner. \nFour men approached garbed in dark robes, bearing incense. A fifth man, all in red, carried a katana housed in an intricate wooden box. \nMinamoto watched them impassively, his face an unreadable mask. \nThe man in red stopped in front of Minamoto. With great sweeping movements he removed the Katana from its wooden box and gracefully held it in two hands. Without a word he pivoted toward the new Shogun sitting in his throne and kneeled. \nTen thousand people waited in abject silence, all eyes on the Shogun. Finally, the Shogun stood, looked pointedly at the man in red, and nodded. \n\"Hai.\"\n The man in red stood up swiftly, spun around and poised the sword blade over Minamoto's heart. It hung there completely still. Minamoto did not blink. \nAnother long pause during which only the incantations of the dark robed figures could be heard. The man in red eventually spoke. \n\"Hanasu. Matawa shizuka ni shinu.\"\nAgain all eyes shifted, now to Minamoto, facing a fate worse than death. Would he break? Would he beg? \nSlowly, half a millimeter at a time, the mask of Minamoto's inscrutable face morphed and transformed, until the impassive line of his lips was upturned and the cold, hard stare of his eyes were thinned in a smile. \nThen he laughed. He laughed brazenly and without a hint of anxiety. He guffawed with such gusto that some of the audience left in fear. All that looked upon him wondered at his insane courage. Even the bearer of the sword wavered almost imperceptively. \nAt last, after the hearty and full bodied laughing was done, his face returned to a passive, stony mask, free of all human feeling, and Minamoto spoke. \n\"Anata no orokana ken de watashi o utte kudasai. Kore wa jikan ga kakari sugimasu, hiza ga itaidesu.\"\nThe man in red obliged him.\n# 2010\n> The USS Washington Carver was christened today. The most modern warship in the NATO arsenal and made entirely of non-virgin steel, the Carver consists in part of token metals taken from the culture of each NATO nation. Most famously the executioners sword of Minamoto no Yoritomo is embedded permanently into the steel of the bridge. The Prime Minister of Japan was present today for the christening, declaring that the ship would add to the fight for global peace and saying Japan was proud to include the ancient sword as a powerful symbolic gesture of the country's indominatable will. \n# 2019 - South China Sea\n\"Incoming!\"\nThe boson's warning was overwhelmed by the crack of a shell cutting through a sattelite dish and landing in the water astern with a deafening explosion. Waves from the impact rocked the ship violently and several sailors fell from the decks into the roiling sea. \nOn the bridge Captain Harris stared straight ahead, toward the north, into the growing storm. The engine was set to full forward, 30 knots into the depths of the violent squall. In the distance the Captain could see churning waves. Experience told him they would be taller than the ship itself. \nBut there was no choice. Behind them two destroyers were in close pursuit, firing with their forward guns as they too bobbed in the tumultuous waves. They came from no where in the night and fired their guns to kill. Several impacts on the upper hull, but no critical damage. \n\"Death on all sides.\" Captain Harris murmured to himself. In the chaos his officers did not hear, but they all saw his face and knew well enough what awaited them. \nAnother shell buzzed toward the ship and landed in the crest of a large wave. Deep beneath the water it exploded, shooting a spray of ice cold salt water 50 meters into the air.\nTheir pursuers understood the Carver's limitations well and followed just outside the effective range of her rear guns, but well within the range of their own forward cannons. \nCaptain Harris steeled himself. The only chance was to evade the enemy in the storm, whatever the danger. \"Forward, come what may.\"\nJust then another call came over the radio. \"Enemy ahead!\" \nThe Captain and his officers ran to the front windows of the bridge and peered into the stormy distance. They saw it out there, one enemy cruiser, somehow, beyond all probability, coming at them through the storm. \nA pincer manuever. Trapped.\nAll hope faded out of the bridge and each man looked one from the other and, ultimately, at the captain. The Captain knew surrender was not an option, the enemy would take no quarter. Nor could they hope to be victorious in a sea battle. But, in the end, there was no choice to make. \n\"Reverse course, bring us broadside to the southerly ships and prepare to bombard.\"\nThe order went out and not a sailor on board doubted that death awaited them. But they would make it a costly death. Slowly the ship turned to the east, its main cannons twisting in the sea spray toward the overwhelming enemy. \nIt began in the engine room. A whisper heard only by an ensign assigned to janitorial work. The young man sat huddled and useless beneath the primary turbine, waiting for a shell to breach the hull and let in the freezing ocean to claim him. \n> \"Ima wa sore ga watashi no tatakaidesu.\"\nThe ensign looked around for the source of the sound, but saw nothing. Standing alone beside the gargantuan turbine he said \"Hello?\"\n> \"Mite kodomo.\"\nA roar began to emanate from the turbine, and a bright blue glow filled the cavernous engine room. The ensign shielded his eyes and tried to report over the radio, but it no longer functioned.\nOn the gun deck the gunmen prepared to fire. The ship was just about lined up with the southeastern enemy ship. The order to fire was about to be given when a distant flash was seen from across the sea. \n\"Incoming!\"\nThe shell flew through the air with a whir, aimed dead center amidship. It should have impacted the Carver mid hull and split her in half. It was the perfect shot. \nBut instead the shell impacted 100 meters from the ship, in mid air. There was a blue flash and then an explosion. The engines tripled in power at the same time and the USS Washington Carver moved speedily of its own accord. \nThe Captain went to his radio with concern. \"Report? What's happening down there?\" \nBut instead of an engineer responding a powerful voice came over every radio on the ship.\n> \"Anata wa ky\u014d meiyo o motte k\u014dd\u014d shimashita. Anata no h\u014dsh\u016b o mite kudasai!\"\nThe guns began to glow bright blue as the cruiser sped through the water like a speed boat. Enemy shells flew in as the enemy ships turned broadside and unleashed withering volleys of artillery. But every shell exploded uselessly against the invisible blue shield.\nThe entire crew watched, mouths agape, as the ship wreaked Poseiden like havoc on the open sea. It went for the south eastern ship first, blasting it with shells from the main guns, each shell glowing a deadly blue as they flew across the sea through the chaos of water and wind. They impacted dead center on the enemy ship and exploded in a mushroom cloud melange of conventional gunpowder and arcs of blue energy. \nEvery man on board the Carver burst into a cheer. Each radio echoed the ship's yell.\n> \"Shinu!\"\nWith whip like speed the ship turned to face the westerly ship. Another blue tinged volley reached out and evaporated the enemy.\nMeanwhile the cruiser coming from inside the storm, seeing the insane power unleashed on its compatriots begun to spin around, back into the mealstrom. \nThe Carver made chase, racing out into the churning sea until it was right beside the enemy cruiser, all the while blocking incoming fire from their rear guns. \nAs the raging ocean plunged each ship up and down, over many dozens of meters, the Carver itself, the voice of the ship, spoke over the main loud speaker forbthe enemy sailors to hear. \n> \"Ima anata wa okuby\u014dmonodesu. Anata wa okuby\u014dmono no shi de shinudeshou!\"\nFrom the aft of the ship a laser like beam of blue energy appeared and, in a half second, sliced lengthwise across the enemy. For a few moments nothing appeared to happen. But when a large wave came, the entire enemy ship split in half horuzontally along its length.  The enemy sailors could be seen screaming, clutching at handrails and falling into the sea, along with the entire top half of their ship.\nIn the aftermath, the Carver brought itself quickly out of the storm and into calm seas. When all was silent the Captain made inquiry in the radio. Not sure what to ask, he said simply. \"Who are you?\"\n> \"Watashi wa anata no hito ga nani o itte iru no ka wakarimasendeshita. Anata wa umaku tatakau node, watashi wa anata o watashi no norikumiin to shite tamotte imasu.\"\nThe captain had no idea what this meant. But he was damned thankful to be alive. \"Well... thanks.\" He said and ordered his men to gently guide the Carver to port.\n## For More Stories\n# r/LFTM\nEdit: introduction added along with some other details\nI purposely left the japanese untranslated as I think it's both uncessary to understand the exact story but also fun, if you're into that sort of thing, to just run it through google translate. \nKeep in mind that's exactly what I did to get the Japanese in the first place, so it is likely rife with errors. \n", "\u201cWhen you take care of your weapon, it will take care of you.  Remember that, my child.  It is a part of you.\u201d\n\u2026\nIt\u2019s the little things that build up to things.  Big things, events; big realizations, ideas.  It always starts somewhere small, and grows and grows with other small things, noticeable or not, dismissed or called out.\nI remember when I first got my blade.\nIt\u2019s a strange thing for a being that has no mind to remember things with.  But I was different then; a different form, a different person.  Young, naive.\nChildren like me weren\u2019t supposed to get a blade.  We didn\u2019t fight, we didn\u2019t scuffle.\nI wanted to.  I wanted to be the hero that I heard of in legends; I wanted to be that name whispered on the wind.  My father didn\u2019t mind.  He loved my smile, he loved my excitement.  He told me more stories, showed me the shapes in the stars at night when the embers of his forge glowed dull.\nIt started with a stick.  A swing at his legs.\n(A new king, and an iron fist)\nA laugh, a smile, and a second stick in his hand.\n(A whisper of unrest, and a quiet dissent)\nA wooden sword, a casual instruction.\n(A crowd, a voice, a worried glance)\nA night training, a night clash.\n(A night meeting and a night ambush)\nI loved my village, I loved them so.  In memory of my father, and in hope for my people, I fought the king\u2019s soldiers until I had no strength, and then fought them some more.\nI should have seen the ones who would eventually betray me and lead my to my death; I agreed to fall upon my own sword to spare the lives of my people.\nBut my people were not spared.\n\u2026 \nI never understood how I knew that.  How I became one with my weapon and watched the ages pass.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, I suppose.\nI was used by the high commander of the new order of the king to slay many.  I remember him disliking me for being improperly balanced, despite my father\u2019s master craftsmanship.  Maybe that was me, maybe that was his ineptitude.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, I suppose.\nThe kingdom eventually fell, overcome by a violent rebellion of its people from the inside, a quiet whisper that built into a roar over many tens of years.\nI was used to slay the king\u2019s ancestors, but I felt no joy or disgust.  My people were gone; why would it matter?\n\u2026\nI was put on display for centuries, never to be used in battle again.  This suited me fine, and I idly watched as my display was at first a wood hook on a wood wall, then metal frame in a glass case.  The building became old and fell in disrepair, so it didn\u2019t take long for roof leak to appear, unnoticed.\nOr the crack to form in the glass.\nOr the moisture to build in the display, or the flecks of rust begin to appear down my length.\nA security guard leaned against my case every night to sleep when he shouldn\u2019t be sleeping.\nA new shop set up nearby that made replicas of myself for others to buy and wave around.\nOne dream too far, I fell to the floor in a crash, and broke.  The guard replaced me with a replica, fearful for his job and his life at a priceless broken artifact.\nIt didn\u2019t matter to me.  I didn\u2019t have anything anyway.\nI was thrown away.\n\u2026\nA war had begun, larger than any war before it.  I don\u2019t remember when or how I was melted into scrap, but it didn\u2019t matter.  I became something else; I became immense.\nFor the first time, I felt free.\nWith a thunder of water and a tremor of steel, I felt the water cool my hull, and the wind caress my deck.  The open air, the open ocean.\nIt was so large.  It was so free.\nAnd then they put weapons on me.  Guns, they called them.  Cannons.  Arrow slingers, but arrows of metal, and bows of fire and steel.\nI was angry.  I just wanted peace; I just wanted a freedom to die or to leave.\nI became the problem child of their navy.  I didn\u2019t care.  I was mad.\nMy engines didn\u2019t work right together, I always curved to one side.  They said it was bad calibration.  Just coincidence it was always toward open sea.  Sometimes my power flickered.  A faulty power line, they said.  Just coincidence it was always at night when the stars were brightest.  My guns would turn on their own.  Crossed wiring.  Brooms fell over during \u2018rough waves\u2019 and happened to trip some people here or there.\nThey would say I was haunted, but who would haunt a brand new ship?\nStill, they dealt with my quirks.

They freed me and repaired me and healed me.\nA small skirmish had appeared, and my first shot struck.

Something worried, something hopeful, something genuine.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, y\u2019fiesty gal,\u201d the engineer would say to me on drunken, starry nights, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the potential, and I\u2019ve got the tools, y\u2019hear?

At sunset a drink to remember their mortality, of themselves, their friends and their family.\nGames were played my halls.  Love was made in my halls.  Promises given, promises taken, and words of hope and of loyalty.\nMy engines were soon calibrated properly.  My guns fixed that glitch in their wires.

The lights flicker, causing a shell to miss us in the dark.\nLoose doors and hatches inexplicably shut when compartments fill with water, keeping it from spreading to crewed quarters as long as they can.  Light flicker in the right places, drawing eyes to incoming fire and enemies.\nI can\u2019t do much, but I give it my all, as much as my people who crew me.\nWhen the dawn finally arrives, I am half under, but my wake is filled with the ruin of my enemies.\nThere\u2019s a tired celebration, a weary song of dawn for one\u2019s country and one\u2019s duty.  It\u2019s cut short by my heavy list; with a heavy heart and a sorrowful voice, my captain gives order to abandon me.\nBut I am okay.   I gave my life to save my people, and though I failed the first time\u2026\nI won\u2019t be remembered, the king\u2019s soldiers said.

The clash on swords rang in my ears as my men were struck down one by one. Men whose names I knew as well as my own. Whose wives I had greeted, and whose children I had held. I heard my family slaughtered. In an instant I felt a change within me. Fire surged through my battered body and my vision cleared. Before me I saw clearly the advancing hoard. A stepped forward, moved not by myself but the new force within me. My men followed, and I staid them with a hand. I raised my sword aloft and charged into the throng. \n\tCarried by instinct and rage my sword flew furiously, cutting down the enemy like wheat. I was slashed and stabbed, bludgeoned, and beat, yet I felt nothing. From behind I heard I cry, and the thunder of boots as my men came to join me. I know not how many we fighters we felled on the field that day, but when the blood-soaked field became quiet bodies covered the ground like sand covers a beach. In that moment, whatever power I had been granted left me. My men gasped as I toppled to the ground, and my sight grew hazy. The last thing I witnessed as a mortal was the sensation of my sword, cold in my hand. And In a dying breath I became steel.  \n\tMy surviving men carried me home. They buried what once was my body and placed my new one in a great hall. I listened to their tears as they mourned those they had lost; I listened to feasts they held in my honor. And though blind, though immobile, though only aware through some extrasensory force, I was satisfied. But time weakens the connection to the mortal realm, and as decades and centuries passed I felt less and less. I suspected my final journey to oblivion would soon complete, and I accepted my fate. But fate it would seem had other plans.\n\tCenturies had lost me, and I had travelled unaware of either the destination or the road. But somehow my tarnished shell found me in a pile of scrap in a shipyard the scale of which the men of my day could never comprehend. I was awoken by a bright, piercing pain. The sensation by then was so foreign that all I knew was a sudden jolt of consciousness. Decades upon decades fell from my soul, and I felt my body grow. I felt rooms inside myself; engines and motors, rudders and blades, powerful weapons of war and thick shields of defense. And finally, I felt life. I was brought to the ocean and laid upon the water. The motor pulsed as my heart, and the blades strode like legs. Men began to occupy my rooms, and they moved through my corridors like blood. In my rooms I heard their secrets. I learned of their wives, their girlfriends, their children. I felt an old emotion surface from deep down. Once again, I was with my men, and once again I was their protector. \n\tBut our peace could not last. After all, I was a warship, and my purpose was to taste battle. We were dispatched to foreign coasts, and my soldiers led us without fear. They laughed and fought, ate and drank, and played games. As we approached, though, my men became nervous. Whispers of a potential ambush permeated, but the garbled voices on my radio insisted they go on. I did not want my family to die but being only a passenger in my own body I was powerless. We sailed on into the treacherous territory of enemy waters. For many days we waited in anxious tension for more orders, but none arrived. My men grew restless, sometimes violent. The paced my rooms and kicked my walls. One neither ate nor slept, only looking off into the horizon. Days and nights passed with no instruction. My men began to believe we had been forgotten. Moral was low, and though I wished I could, there was no way to help them.     \n\tThen one day a shout came from my upper deck. Somehow in the night our location had been determined and we had become surrounded. A couple of miles out in every direction the enemy was approaching. My men were scared, but they remained at their post. They knew there would be know surrender, only the hope to take as many of the enemy with them as they could. The ship approached further and then the barrage began. I felt a pain through my entire being with the first hit and felt the shock waves of missed shots all around. My men shouted orders and scream when they were lacerated with shrapnel. I was hit again, and I felt the death inside me. I felt the blood of my men stain the floors. I felt my family being taken from me once more. \nAn artillery shell hit my side and I began to take on water. My soldiers yelled and dove overboard. Some found life rafts and tried to help the other. All I felt was the pain and chaos and twisted metal of my body. The boats approached closer, and as the evening lights dimmed the water turned red with the sky. The waves looked like hills, and the bodies of my men - living and slain - dotted them. An ancient ache rose within me, and with the scream of splitting metal in me I left my body. I travelled over my men and saw the fear their faces, and the resignation. I saw the tears that stained their cheeks for those they lost, and I saw the fast-approaching ships. Separate from my body, I felt myself dragged into oblivion, but with the last of my strength I fought the void. I sent myself out and climbed into the enemy\u2019 s ships. I felt the walls, the motors, and the guns. I encompassed them, and heard the gasps as cracks appeared in the decks and walls. One by one the enemy ships began to sink. As I floated away I heard my men shout, first in confusion then in triumph. The cheers of men who knew that there was someone, somewhere watching over them. I bid my family goodbye one last time and slipped peacefully into nothing.\n", "Asger pierced saxon's heart with his blade. He pulled his sword out, and the saxon's corpse collapsed onto the pile of bodies around Asger.   Asger wasn't supposed to be fighting. Asger Ragnulf, feared viking warrior, was supposed to be leading his men raiding quiet seaside village.  But the seaside village turned out to be elaborate trap set up by saxons to kill Asger and end his reign of terror, and Asger and his crew of thirty men ended up being surrounded by hundred and fifty saxon warriors. Knowing that escape was impossible, Asger fought with terrifying bloodlust, falling twenty men before succumbing to sheer numbers. As he swung his sword with all his might, with his consciousness slowly fading,  he looked up to the sky and saw Valhalla waiting for him....\nThousand and five hundred years later, his soul finally ended up in Valhalla....\n2512, UCS Valhalla, alpha centauri orbit.\nCaptain Godfrid stood inside bridge of his ship, contemplating situation he was in. Valhalla, newly commissioned heavy cruiser of United Coalitions navy, had state of arts carbon nanotube reinforced magnesium steel hull, with active directed energy shielding that protected the ship from everything short of twenty megaton kinetic projectile. Against kinetic projectiles, the ship's AI automatically applied thrusters to maneuver out of their way. However, machine had it's limits, and combat against multiple alien capital ships was one of them. What started out as simple rescue operation of civilian ship somehow escalated into head on combat against 2 capital ships. Valhalla fought tooth and nail - more accurately, with railgun and nuclear torpedoes - but Godfrid was aware that it was a losing battle, and only thing Valhalla could do was to inflict as much damage as she can before going down....\nMaybe it was Godfrid's Nordic ancestry. Or maybe it was his willpower. Nevertheless, it awakened spirit of Asger on the ship, dormant in steel alloy that contained metal from Asger's sword. Asger's spirit gave Godfrid courag, determination, and most importantly, an idea. It was seemingly suicidal idea, but Godfrid somehow knew that it was going to work. Valhalla slingshotted around a planet, positioning itself behind enemy ships. Valhalla then fired a torpedo at one enemy ship, causing it to maneuver away to lose it. Using this opportunity, Valhalla rammed other enemy ship, disabling both their thrusters. First enemy ship that now lost torpedo following it fired it's torpedo on Valhalla. Valhalla, in unprecedented maneuver, used knockback from railgun to move behind enemy ship, using it as a shield against incoming torpedo. Torpedo, unable to change course, crashed into disabled alien ship, destroying it. Remaining alien ship moved towards Valhalla to board it, knowing that it is disabled and will not be able to fight back....only to realize that Valhalla is fully operational and already fired it's entire arsenal at second enemy ship. Aliens did not realize this, but Valhalla had backup generators not present in past UCS cruisers, and this allowed Valhalla to recover from collision quickly. Alien ship tried to retaliate, but Valhalla's arsenal of torpedoes and railguns overpowered defenses and destroyed last alien ship.\nGodfrid dismissed powerful presence he felt during battle alpha centauri as adrenaline rush, but deep inside his mind, he knew that something, or someone, was there with him in battle.\n"]}
