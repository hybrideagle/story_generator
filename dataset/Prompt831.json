{"You are a superhero that wields the power of plot twist. You always somehow manage to save the day with unexpected events when you are about to lose. One day, you have met your match; a supervillain that wields the power of plot holes.\n": ["Rain gathered and buildings crashed, dust billowed and a gust of wind carried it through the city--two figures stood apart beneath the cloudy grey city skyline. \nThe caped man stumbled, and fell back--reaching toward the dull sky.\nA young woman--possibly a teen--stepped closer to him, the look of utter satisfaction spread across her perfect perfect lips and glistening marble skin. She smiled, and two long and pointy fangs were bore.  \"It is \n like over,\" She said. \"This is like, totally no longer your city.\"\nThe man's eyes lost their spirit, and he could hardly move. Drops of rain hit his forehead. He just stared up at the sky--and he saw hope. \"I don't think so.\" He said, and the drops rain began to lessen.\nThe teen approached him and leaned over. \"You've lost, just like--accept it.\"\n\"I can't accept a world where people like you think you can rule.\" He scoffed, and a little but of blood dribbled out from the side of his mouth. \"I can barely life a finger, but for your sake, I think I'll manage this...\"\nThe man began to weakly raise his hand, and pointed his finger to the sky. \nThe girl looked up, and through the clouds a beam of light peered through and illuminated the young teen's face.  She looked down after taking in the ray--\"So?\" she said.\nThe man's eyes widened, \"But I thought sunlight was you--\" His mouth was grabbed and she begun to lift him from the ground with her perfectly manicured hands. Her luscious and utterly voluminous hair glistened perfectly in the light.\nIn the moment he was being lifted--the man realized something was near--a piece of a wooden chair leg that was broken in a way to give it a point. The man didn't question his luck--and grabbed it. With all his strength he shoved it deep into the girl's heart. \nLike wings of blood--spraying out from her back, splattering into the air and ground with a raging force.  She smiled, \"That won't work on me anymore.\" She said, tossing the man, his divine luck and efforts aside with a hand wave--he collided into a pile of rubble. \"I am like, so much stronger than you think. I am the hero this world needs, just move aside old man.\"\n\"No.\" He said. \n\"Rude.\" she said. \"Like, whatever. I'll let you be ungrateful. It is a new era.\"\n\"No.\" He said. \"You think everyone will fall for you and be alright with you, don't you? Because you think you are perfect all the time.\" \n\"I am just your average teen-hero-vampire.\" She said, and flicked her hair. \"And you are so old news. I've beat you, you lost. Give up.\"\nThe man couldn't move anymore--he could feel the rebar sticking through his side. \"I'll admit I've lost. I'm pretty weak compared to a lot of people, and I know that. But I always try my best and to do what is right. Here is a thing you might have never heard before in your perfect fantasy life--it is okay to lose. It happens.\"\n\"You don't need to say anymore, I've heard enough of old people thinking they like know anything.\" She said, and turned her back on him. \"I've kicked your butt, and I've won today.\"\nHe closed his eyes. \"You think you've won today... Heh. Think like that if you want. I'm not giving up.\"\n\"Fight me, go ahead. I'll beat you down every time you come at me.\"\n\"Plot twist,\" He said with a smile realizing something-- he clutched his side and stemming the flow of blood that was beginning to form a  thick puddle around him. \"I'm not going to fight you like you want. I see now you're just a kid. Even if it is the last thing I do, I will make you see how the adult world really is.\"\n\"Shut up.\" She said. \n\"You can't hide in your perfect little world forever. You'll grow up one--\"\n\"Shut up!\" She was as quick as the fastest superhero out there--maybe faster. \"Shut up!\" She was right upon the man--raising her hand up and bringing it down upon his chest. Blood splattered, and bones crunched beneath her blow.\nBlood soaked her hand, and she breathed out. \"I'm the hero. There is no place in the world for you, old--...\" \nSomething moved, and the girl spotted a small crowd of people hiding among the destroyed havoc of the city. They looked on with horror at what she had done.\nShe looked down at the man, limp and lifeless. \"Old man... I'm the hero.\"\nThere was a child in the crowd, and tears began to well in their eyes, dropping a doll of caped man.\nShe stood tall, and she could see the crowd cower and gasp at her movement. Looking at her bloodied hand. \"I'm the hero... Right?\"\n"]}
