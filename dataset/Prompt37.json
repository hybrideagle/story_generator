{"You wake up with an app you didn't recall installing called \"Earth\". Within are a very specific & detailed interface with temperature, population, wildlife, etc. You mess around with it until you realize that the app is applying what you've changed on it to reality.\n": ["He woke up to a familiar buzzing from his phone. His small cupboard of a room could barely hold the mattress he slept on, as he was unreasonably tall. His white cardboard box he called a nightstand which was slightly off balance, and a singular lamp are all that made him what he is today. When he glanced at the phone, he noticed it wasn't his alarm making the buzz, but an app called \"Earth-chan\".\nEarth-chan, huh? Sure he wasn't all that into anime or anime tropes, but he was curious, and he found the meme in good taste so he opened it up. What stared at him was a still image of a girl in a white T-shirt with NASA as a sticker on the front, with hair that resembled the earth all around, like a globe.\nWait, this wasn't a still image. The girl spoke.\n\"Hiiiiii~\"\nHe threw the phone straight in front of him, smashing his only lamp. Before it even hit, he was under the covers of his tattered blanket, only fitting because he curled into a fetal position. The lamp breaking prompted his friend and roommate Greg to run into the room. Surviving in a low income African neighborhood for years before, Greg brought his bat along.\n\"Matt! What the fuck!? Are you good man?\"\n\"Earth... but the... I thought...\"\nGreg paused. He knew Matt was quick to get over what ailed him.\n\"I heard this buzzing so I tapped it and there was this image of Earth-chan, and she... she spoke.\"\n\"...Earth-chan?\"\n\"The anime girl that gets weebs to stop littering.\"\n\"Oh yeah, I think I saw one of those.\" Greg picked up the phone among the broken shards of glass.\n\"Hiiiiii~\" said once again by the short anime girl.\n\"I see...\" Greg said to no one as Matt walked up to him and the phone.\n\"Is this some sort of AI?\" Matt pondered.\n\"I don't know, but it's not that cree-\"\n\"I can hear you all, you know. So don't pretend I'm not here just because I'm so short! >:(\" Earth-chan raised her voice.\nGreg and Matt jumped back.\n\"I take that as a yes.\"\n\"So what are you doing here, Earth-chan?\"\n\"I don't know :3. I guess I just wanted someone to talk to...\"\nMatt was a bit of a smartypants, and had an idea. \"Hold on, I have an idea. Earth-chan, twirl around for a bit.\" He asked.\n\"Ok! <3\"\nAs she twirled around, Matt and Greg took care to notice the window, which was almost blasted open by strong winds.\n\"Interesting.\" was all Matt could say, trying to keep a straight face.\nGreg was catching onto what Matt was thinking but couldn't believe it. Then he noticed a little black speck on Earth-chans hair. \"Hey Earth-chan, you got a little schmutz...\" He pointed to the spot on the head her schmutz was.\n\"Oh! Woopsie! :) You're so attentive and caring, Greg-kun!\"\n\"Hey, how does she know our names??\"\n\"Contact list, silly! :P\"\n\"That's creepy, but makes sense. Hey, I'm getting a tweet. ...Uh, Matt? You may want to look at this.\"\nMatt took his phone out of Gregs hand and looked at Gregs phone. The preview of the tweet read: Magnitude 9.9 earthquake hits New York, multiple buildings leveled, up to millions killed.\n\"Uh oh...\" was all Greg could muster. The realization hit him like a bat to the head; Greg had killed millions by telling Earth-chan to fix her hair. He slowly sank to the ground, not knowing what else to do.\n\"How are you doing, Matt-kun?\" Earth-chan said, without a care in the world, but she was ignored.\nMatt needed to do something quick to cheer up his friend and figure out how to fix this. \"Hey Greg... we don't know what we did. It was a mistake. And it hurts, really bad. But now we know. We can use Earth-chan here to make sure the world is safe! The meme may work! We have so much power in our hands, and from now on, we will use it only for good!\" It seemed to cheer Greg up a little.\n\"Alright boys, I'm going to go take a shower. Bye-bye!\" Earth-chan said before leaving.\n\"Wait, what?\"\n\"Oh shit...\"\n\"But if she's taking a shower, then that means... her hair...\"\nGreg took the bat and smashed Matt's phone to pieces, only leaving random computer chips and bits of screen left. Matt wasn't that mad.\n\"Did we do it in time?\"\n\"I think we'll know for sure soon.\"\n"]}
