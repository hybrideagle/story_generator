{"Everyday, you reach into your magic bag and get whatever you will need most in the day. Most days it's a gun. But today, you got something else...\n": ["I sigh and reach into the bag, ready for my fingers to latch onto the cool metal of the usual revolver. It's been twelve days since the last time it was something else, and then it had been a semi-automatic handgun. There's velvet, velvet, and - that's not metal. \nI retract my hand and pull the mouth of the bag open wider to peer into it. There at the bottom is a small black kitten, eyes glinting in the dim light of the bag. \n\"Oh god,\" I groan, reaching back in to draw the cat out. It settles into my palms with a happy mew before flopping over to lick itself. \"What am I supposed to do with *this*?\"\n", "Two weeks after the EMP, when I was sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that I would die in this new dark world, I found the green canvas bag, in barn still several hundred miles away from civilization. There was a shiny new .45 inside.\nI quickly realized that this was no ordinary bag when I was unable to put the gun back inside. It wasn't a physical incapability but not quite a mental one either.\nI decided to set up camp in the woods behind the barn where I'd discovered the mysterious artifact. I sat for what seemed like hours trying to break whatever force that was compelling me not to put anything into the bag. I could pick up the item that I intended to store, but there seemed to be some kind of blockage when my brain sent the orders to my hand to actually insert the item. I could push but I had no strength, like trying to scream when deep within a nightmare.\nThe sound of rustling foliage broke my intense concentration. It was followed by rapid footfalls on the forest floor. I racked the pistol and leveled it in the direction of the noise. The man's knife glinted in the light of the fire. I unloaded in his general direction, and he hit the ground face first like a sack of potatoes and half slid, half rolled across the ground almost to my feet. \nThe next morning I looked at the bag only to see another gun shaped mass silhouetted inside of it. I looked to gun I had pulled from the bag the previous day, still sitting next to my bed roll. I had no idea what was happening, had someone else snuck into my camp and put another gun in the bag? There was no way I could have just missed the fact that another gun was in there but I knew that whatever was going on, it was time to move on.\nAfter two weeks I was sure of two things in relation to the nature of the bag. \nFirstly each day when I awoke there would be a new item or sometimes multiple items in the bag. These item's seemed to be whatever I would need most, whatever was the most detrimental to my survival or success that day. Though sometimes it seemed entirely random.\nSecond the bag didn't seem to care whether or not I already had such an item, it would just give me one anyways. This was becoming increasingly annoying as I now had 8 different hanguns and 4 knives.\nBy the fourth week, Gun count: 17, I had become aware of several more properties of my faithful, yet somewhat infuriating, companion. \nThe bag would give me a weekly ration of food, but in it's usual overtly inconvenient style the bag didn't seem to care which day I would recieve the food or even how much food it would be, in fact it almost seemed purposefully malicious. Midway through the first week, nearly starving, I recieved 37 cans of spam, I famously hated spam, and nearly decided to just allow myself to starve to death. The second week, on monday, I got a single radish, I was subsequently forced to continue gagging with every bite of every meal, choking down can after can of congealed \"meat\". \nI ran out of spam and wasn't given anymore food until the following sunday when I recieved 12 MREs dated 1968. I was pleasently surprised to find that the freeze dried foods didn't actually seem to be fifty plus years old and was ecstatic to find small packs of Marlboro reds within the care packages. The next day, a new week, I recieved 58 more cans of spam.\nI also learned that if the item I was being so benevolently bestowed was too large for the bag, the little green satchel would simply grow to envelope the item. I came into this knowledge when I was rudely awoken at the crack of dawn by the blood curdling screams of a panicking animal. I jumped to my feet, gun in hand, only to see a gigantic writhing green mass in my camp.\nIt was quite obviously a horse and carriage, and I was then left with the task of extracting a giant panicking beast AND carriage from a big, stupid, green bag. \nAfter several hours of comically ridiculous antics I was finally able to free the horse and carriage. On one hand I was greatful, because I now had too much bag-junk to carry on my own, but once again the bag bested me as I was unable travel that day. This was on account of the fact that I hadn't any room for my supplies because the bag did not shrink back to normal size and took almost all the room in the carraige.\nAfter only several minutes of rest the horse looked at me in the most peculiar way.\n\"How the fuck did I get in there?\" He asked.\n", "You reach into the bag, expecting the cold metal of the revolver which had been your faithful companion for weeks. Instead, you feel rough fabric, with a hard plate under it. There's a second one, just like it. With a little struggling, you pull out a bulletproof vest. \n\"Shit.\"\n"]}
