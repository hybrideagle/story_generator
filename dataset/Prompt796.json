{"Aliens come to Earth from all across the galaxy to establish trade. This is because Earth has an abundance of a rare plant used in high class restaurants of alien worlds, the Ancient Rejuvenation Herb or as we call it 'Weed'.\n": ["\u201cDude, like, who are you? Did someone lace my herb? Shiiit,\u201d Randy said, extremely stoned, walking the streets of his Los Angeles neighborhood, with two strange humanoids standing in front of him.\n\u201cHuman, we are here to trade. We desire this Ancient Rejuvenation Herb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Hell no am I giving you my weed. I paid like 20 bucks for this. This is good kush!\u201d\n\u201cWe will offer you one million Aterian Credits for the Herb.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is that in dollars?\u201d\n\u201cIt is about...$67.39 USD. It is a fair exchange, is it not?\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t! Now get the hell out of my fuckin\u2019 way, I gotta get to Taco Bell. I\u2019m getting the munchies.\u201d\nThe Aterians pull out a ray weapon, \u201cI would not do that, human. You would be making a grave error. Just give us the Herb and we will be on our way.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already told you, man. I\u2019m not givin\u2019 you my weed!\u201d\nThe Aterians fire the ray weapon by Randy\u2019s feet. \u201cWe do not play games, human. Now give us the Herb, or prepare for vaporization.\u201d\n\u201cOk, fine, Jesus Christ. Fuckin\u2019 freaks,\u201d Randy swore. \u201cI mean, maybe I can buy some decent weed with this.\u201d And he caught his bus to Chinatown.\n"]}
