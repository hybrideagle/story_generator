{"Humanity had mastered Intergalactic travel around 7.2 million years ago and sent out ships to Andromeda. Since then, we've forgotten our heritage and today, an Ancient Human ship turns up in orbit around Earth.\n": ["Something was clearly very wrong.\nEver since their deceleration and entrance into the Oort cloud, the crew found themselves surrounded by deafening silence from the Sol system.\nNot a single Earth Defense Outpost responded to hails when they entered the primary cargo lane for mining traffic for Earth.  Not a single observation vessel asking for their call signs.\nNothing.\nComms went through every single channel.  Government, civilian, industrial, military, each line dead.  Dead, dead, dead.\nA strange tune for a once bustling corner of the Milky Way.\nThey passed Pluto and found nothing.  Sure, it was a backwater and only use for launching between systems, but you could usually find at least one or two orbital stations selling cheap tubes of nutrient paste or some hand me down weapons from some forgotten colonial dust up.  But nothing.  Not even debris in the orbit, just the same sad little rock.  \nPast the gas giants.  Now the concern had begun to spread around the crew.  Their systems had taken some damage when they arrived in Andromeda, passing too close to a gas giant during deceleration.  Too much energy spent preventing the vessel from crashing and folding into the center of the planet.\nQuietly the captain began to review the protocol for a code black, and even though he believed in the strength of the Human Empire, in his heart he began to grapple with the truth.\nA spacefaring race knows the greatest enemy in colonization is time.  For hundreds of years, all humans knew.  Time was relative.\nRelativity was the enemy.\nWhen a crew departed from orbit, they knew fairly well that those they left behind would likely be dead when they returned.\nSuch was life for a pioneer.\nWhen they went past Saturn, everybody knew.  They had tracked the body, searching for additional vehicle traffic.\nNothing.\nNothing.\nSilence.\nThe Titan Station, home to humanity's greatest space station, outside of the modern civilian platforms in orbit around Earth, was nowhere to be seen.  No ruins.  No debris.  No energy waves of any kind, completely undetectable.\nIt was just a rock.\nJust like all the others.\nAnother great truth about space travel.  It's a maddeningly lonely business.\nSome in the crew began to panic.  They'd returned to the Sol system for repairs, and something had gone terribly wrong.  Not a single human anywhere.  \nTo the captain, it was just sad.  He'd been born among the twinkling lights of Titan, watching military craft dock and restock before taking the fight to whatever colony had decided to rebel.  Stern men with stern faces.  \nHe wondered what had happened, but put it from his mind.  They would most likely never know.\nIt made the rest of the return a little more bearable.  When you finally accept a horrible truth, the cascade of additional horrible realities tend to be more palatable.  Nothing by Jupiter.  Nothing by Mars; the planet in fact had lost its artificial magnetosphere.  The place would have been entirely uninhabitable for quite a long time, and Earth installations had been deep underground anyway.  Experimental technology only, on Mars.  A sad red ball.\nNow onto the sad blue ball.\nIn came signals, but these were ancient and primitive in nature.  Neither were they actually directed towards the craft.\nRadio?\nWere they fucking serious?\nIt could be worse.  There could be no signal.\nThey found the words strange and indecipherable.  Not a single one of the languages spoken and intercepted matched any other on record.\nAnd the planet was clearly occupied by humans, but the crew had no idea the nature of the situation.  Were they a unified race?  What had happened?  Where were the orbital stations?  Their cities were large, but clearly dirty.  Much of it appeared to still be destroyed after some great conflict, ash and charred material all over different parts of the world.\nThe craft landed instead of staying in orbit.  Whatever help they would receive, they would have to interact with the humans on the surface.\nDown they went, landing within a desert.  Barren but beautiful.  \nHumans arrived fairly soon afterward, in olive jeeps with great white stars upon them.  The captain and crew came out to greet their fellow humans.\nThey were all civilians.\nAn observational mining group, tagging particularly abundant rock planets for consumption and processing.\nAll unarmed.  All in plain garments, so as to prevent scaring whatever humans they came across.  Here they were all people, and people help each other.\nThe men in the jeeps shot them all dead with little warning with primitive kinetic weapons and captured the craft, spiriting it away for study.  They congratulated themselves on a job well done, shaking hands.  No one took pictures of the corpses, which were burned rather than buried.\nTo the humans that lived nearby, to the best of their knowledge nothing had happened really.\nTheir military told them it was just a weather balloon that had fallen to the ground.\nSomewhere near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.\nr/storiesfromapotato - *X files theme plays softly in the background, a potato and a knife in a flying saucer*\n", "Silje had heard stories of earth from her grandmother, she\u2019d been one of the original colonists on the Earth Ship Aurora, that had left earth all those years ago. Time dilation meant the earth her grandmother had left would be vastly different now, although only three generation removed from Earthers, those born on earth, 7.2 million years would have past for Earth. \nThat was the reason Silje now commanded the Andromeda Ship Aurora. When it had arrived in the Andromeda system they had expected a welcome party. See by the time the original colonists had arrived, earth would have had 3.6 million years to improve on engine design as well as theoretical physics such as quantum teleportation. There was a premise based on the fact that at the time the Aurora had left earth, technological advancement had been growing exponentially since The Time of Steam. The premise was that any ship that was sent to a distant star from earth, would be beat to their destination by a ship with superior technology that had launched long after the original ship had. But there was no welcome party, and for the 60 years it took the get the Aurora ready for the return trip, nothing had arrived from earth at all. \nA further 44 years had passed since a young 20 year old go getter had taken command of said ship and taken it back out into the stars. There had been celebration on launch day, finally they could reconnect with earth, but every single person knew that something must have gone terribly wrong. For Earth to not send any other vessels at all, not even a second Colony class ship from the Aurora line, something had to be up. There was plans when the Aurora left for a further four ships to leave in the following ten years, the next ship had already been named the Swan Song and begun production. \nSilje was interrupted from her thoughts by a voice addressing her\n\u201cCaptain, we\u2019re approaching the asteroid belt now, still no signs of any vessels or space stations\u201d \nSilje looked to her left and gave her second in command a thin smile before reaching down to pick up a small communication unit ready to address the whole ship.\n\u201cTo all members of the Andromeda Ship Aurora, we are now on our final approach to earth. As of yet we\u2019ve found next to know evidence of human life within the Sol solar system, but we have picked up signals from earth, mostly old methods of communication but evidence of a planet wide communications network. We can\u2019t be sure what awaits us on earth so I want all security teams in full tactical gear and on stand by-\u201d \nA warning light on Siljes console in front of her interrupted her train of thought, she muted her communications before addressing her bridge.\n\u201cStatus report\u201d\n\u201cCaptain, there is a small vessel approaching us\u201d Replied one of the helmsman, gesturing to the observation screen as he brought up an image showing a small shape moving towards them.\n\u201cWhy are we only seeing this now?\u201d\nSilje asked, concern creeping into her voice\n\u201cIt appears to be adrift, it\u2019s being propelled by gravity and inertia alone, no communication equipment\u2026 but I am picking up\u2026 is that?\u201d \nCommunications Officer Stefan trailed off for a second, Silje cleared her throat as a polite reminder that the bridge was awaiting his analysis. \n\u201cCaptain\u2026 the object appears to be emitting sound waves, they\u2019re very weak but there is some sort of speaker emitting sound into space\u201d\nWith that Communication Officer Stefan pressed a button and a crackled messaged began to play to the bridge.\n\u201cPlanet earth is blue - nothing - do\u201d \nThe messaged dropped out a few times, and seemed to be accompanied by a rhythmic droning that was hard to make out. \nThe bridge grew quiet. Proof that humanity was still around was a good thing, but what they were now seeing on the observation screen didn\u2019t quite make any sense. The object had continued on its course towards them and they could all now quite clearly see what it was. A humanoid figure in a crude looking atmosphere suit, sat in some sort of bright red control centre that opened directly into space. The control centre itself seemed oddly tacked onto what looked like some sort of small engine. A dim light radiated from one of the control panels in the red control centre, and reflected off visor of the oddly still humanoids atmosphere suit. A simple message.\nDon\u2019t Panic. \n"]}
