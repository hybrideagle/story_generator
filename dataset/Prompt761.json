{"You successfully tricked everyone with your disguise. Problem is, you start to confuse which one is your true self.\n": ["I entered the goblin camp, with just on though in mind. Find out how many goblin are stationed at camp and find any weaknesses on the defenses.\nI got inside without any problems at all. They were all dancing around the bonfire. At least 50 of them. I hesitated, if they found out that I was a human spy, I'd be dead ASAP. A goblin came out behind me. *Shit, should I run?*.\nIt pushed me, at first I though it wanted to fight me, later I realized that it just wanted me to join the *bonfire dance*. So, I did. At first I did not know what to do. Then I realized that there was not a specific set of moves to follow, one just had to go with the flow of the drums. So I danced, after a few minutes I began to like it. We danced for a couple of hours straight. It was exhausting.\nI met this young and nice goblin couple, with a goblin newborn. They seemed to take good care of it. The newborn doesn't seem as ugly as the rest of them.\nThat's when I saw him. The goblin chief. Wielding a minotaur horn necklace, as a trophy and to show of its grandeur. *Know would be my chance to assassinate him, they'll kill me afterwards but it would plant enough chaos for my men to attack*, I hesitated. He walked right beside me and walked to the couple with the baby goblin. He gave the newborn a kiss on the forehead.\nI walked out of camp, unnoticed. I was meeting one my men to brief them. When I got to the meeting point I was attacked by a human. He tackled me, I hit the ground. He's on top of me, his arms on top of mine, I'm trapped. Can't get out.\n\"Are you the general?\" -- He asked. *No idea what he's talking about*. -- \"Yes...\" -- I answered. He got off of me. Damn humans, I just hate them. They are so tall, they are everywhere and they believe that they can conquer whatever they please. Not *my* camp.\n\"So, how big is the resistance?\" -- He asked. I get up, grab my dagger from my belt and stab him in the stomach. He seemed surprised, what did he expect? He attacked *me* first. Damn humans, where there is one, more are usually nearby, so I move silently, looking for any human camp. Found it, they are about 20 men stationed there. I go back to camp and inform the goblin chief about the camp location. He sent about 30 goblin to attack the camp. *We will be safe now, they'll get rid of the humans*.\nI just watched them leave to battle. *Am I...human?*. *What have I done?*. *Who...am I?*\n"]}
