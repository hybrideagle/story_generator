{"A genetic test was found that reliably predicts sociopathic behavior at near 100%. The average of society has an incidence rate of approximately 0.4%. Politicians, however, tested at near 50% incidence, and already strained public opinion reaches its breaking point.\n": ["\"Please, so what if I got 75% on the psychometer, I could get a 90% on the sociopath detector and people would still vote for me over you!\" laughed the democrat nominee at the 2020 presidential debate, \"three reasons why: #1 I'm tough on guns, tough on Russians, and tough on crime. #2 I will bring the jobs back not through trickle down economics, but through expanding government jobs, bringing more police into the force to protect schools, and #3 look at these huuuge, muscular hands.\" The sea of blue hats whooped and cheered \"Make America Greater!\" \"Make America Greater!\"  A new sociopath was in town, bigglier and more outrageous than the president elect could wish to be. At first it was a bummer to find out that Tom Hanks of all people, had turned out to be a psycho, but at this point people had reached their breaking point. With politicians often 50% over the prick-tor scale and even girl scouts often failing the test (no surprise, those little monsters would sell a box of sugar to a diabetic to make $4), Americans just didn't care anymore. Maybe it was violent tv or video games or fluoride in the water, who knows why so many people were coming up F.U.-positive. Even political sides and issues didn't matter anymore. Americans knew nothing was going to change.  What really mattered was this guy had a butter smooth voice, kind fatherly overtones, and promised to delete his twitter account if elected.\nedit: Grammar and a poor attempt to make it a bit more politically neutral. Sorry if I offend anyone's beliefs, the prompt says both sides are equally sociopathic.  \n"]}
