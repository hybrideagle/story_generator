{"A little girl makes an innocent birthday wish. Suddenly one of every Pok\u00e9mon appear in our world.\n": ["\"So, we gonna do this the easy way, or the hard way?\"\nTwo men, both clad in all black and wearing old hockey masks, had me cornered in a dark alley. While this armed robbery surprised me at first, I soon knew exactly what it was that these guys wanted.\n\"Just hand over the damn Pok\u00e9ball, and we'll leave ya' alone.\"\nEver since that little girl made her famous birthday wish, people had been trying to get their hands on their own Pok\u00e9mon in whatever ways they could. I was lucky enough to befriend and catch a Slurpuff on the first day, but not many others had the same fortune.\nIt only took a week before there were reports of the first Pok\u00e9mon related death, when some guy got shot after refusing to give the Riolu he caught to his \"friend\".\nAnd now, I was a victim of another one of these robberies.\nI slowly placed my hand upon the Pok\u00e9ball that was fastened to my hip, hovering my index finger over the metal button on the front.\n\"You're not taking Slurpuff away from me.\"\nThe two men obviously didn't take this retaliation well. The taller, more muscular man slowly strode behind me, and rested his knife directly underneath my throat. His buddy stood at the entrance to the alley, looking out for any passing pedestrians or cops that might witness the act.\n\"Any last words, kiddo?\" The man behind me asked.\nAs I felt the cold metal blade briefly press against my throat, I slowly pressed the button on my Pok\u00e9ball.\n\"Yeah. Slurpuff, play rough!\"\nBefore the large man could react, Slurpuff jumped at him and started relentlessly punching his face, not letting up until he was lying unconscious on the ground. The second man ran off once his partner hit the ground, dropping his knife and a wallet as he bolted down the street.\nOnce I was sure that the first man was down for the count, I walked over to the wallet and opened it up. The only thing I found inside was a hundred-dollar bill, which I pocketed for future use. The guy definitely wasn't coming back, and even if he did, he probably wouldn't report that some kid he tried to kill took some pocket change from him.\nAfter stuffing the money in my pocket, I turned around to see Slurpuff staring at me, the same dopey grin she always had still plastered on her face. After letting her bounce around for a few moments, I pulled the Pok\u00e9ball off of my belt, held it towards Slurpuff, and pressed the button.\n\"Sorry girl, but it isn't safe for you out here. We'll be home soon though, so don't worry.\"\nAfter Slurpuff had been contained within her Pok\u00e9ball, I slowly looked out from the alley, making sure there was nobody suspicious-looking on the street, and began the short walk home. Even though having a Pok\u00e9mon in this day and age meant that you were wearing a giant target on your back, I still loved my new friend, and knew damn well that I wasn't going to let anything bad happen to her.\n", "\"I knew this was a bad idea!\"\n\"Just shut up and keep running!\" Jeff shouted back at Mary.\nThe ground shook as the colossal beast slithered closer, gaining speed. Its roar pulsed through the air. A Screech attack. Jeff held his ears closed tight, feeling like they'd begin bleeding any moment.\n\"Why did you have to try and capture it!?\" Mary yelled at him. \"You know that Pok\u00e9balls don't work right? This isn't like the games you idiot!\"\n\"Well I just thought-\"\n\"You thought wrong!\"\nA shadow passed over the two of them, and a boulder landed right ahead. A Rock Throw? Both of them looked back, and silently prayed for their lives.\nThe trees fell apart to reveal the thirty foot tall monstrosity, iron snake Pok\u00e9mon, Steelix.\n\"Any more bright ideas, Jeff?\" Mary hissed at him.\n\"Just one.\" Jeff brought his hand to his mouth, cupped it, then yelled. \"Aria! Use Flamethrower!\"\nThe Steelix seemed confused for a moment, until a burst of flame erupted from above. It struck dead center of the Pok\u00e9mon, and it recoiled in pain. It was part steel so Jeff grinned, knowing it was super effective.\nA red-feathered bird swooped down, and landed next to its trainer.\n\"Nice to see you Aria.\" Jeff grinned to the Talonflame. \"How about we take down this thing together?\"\nAria nodded in agreement, and flew back into the air, ready for action.\nMary almost seemed impressed. \"Nice going, now we just have to hope your bird can actually win.\"\n\"Oh, she will. Let's go Aria!\" Jeff cheered to his Pok\u00e9mon, who responded with a confident cry.\nThe fight had only just begun.\n", "The news had reported it, and everyone was going frantic. Pokemon had started appearing. And with the Pokemon, came Poke-Balls. Six appeared for every person, and people were trying to catch them. The twist was, only one of each Pokemon came. \nI had to catch one. Just one would be good enough! I had been a fan since I was a kid, and having one of my own would be a dream come true. I took my Pokeballs, and ran outside. I live in a small neighborhood mostly populated by adults, and no kids. I looked around, when I saw it. There was a little Wurmple crawling in the grass. \u201cYes!\u201d I cheered, and readied my Pokeball. \u201cYou\u2019re mine!\u201d The Wurmple turned, and got hit in the side with my Pokeball. \nThe Wurmple was pulled into the ball, and it clunked to the ground. It wiggled once. Then twice. Then a third time. Then no movements. I anxiously waited, when I heard a click. And the Pokeball didn\u2019t move. I was still in shock, before my body decided to respond, and I sprinted towards the Pokeball. \u201cYes Yes Yes! I caught Wurmple!\u201d I picked it up, held it in the sunlight, and admired it. \nMy first Pokemon. If I were any younger, I would be dead from excitement. \u201cWurmple, I choose you!\u201d I threw the Pokeball, and in a flash of white light, Wurmple appeared. It looked curiously at its new surroundings, before I bent down to it. \u201cWurmple, I just caught you. Let\u2019s be friends!\u201d Wurmple smiled, and made a noise of agreement. \nThen, we heard a little sound in the distance. I saw it in my neighbors tree. I picked up Wurmple, and ran over there. When we got close enough, I saw a Litten in the tree. \u201cOh, Yes! Wurmple, we have to catch it!\u201d I took out another Pokeball, and got ready to throw. \u201cPokeball, Go!\u201d I chucked the Pokeball at Litten, and it hit it in the face. Litten was pulled into the ball, and it began shaking. Once. Then twice. Then the ball opened and came back to me. \n\u201cAh, it\u2019s not weak enough! Wurmple\u2019s at a disadvantage...\u201d Litten got mad, and used Ember. Wurmple began dodging, but it wasn\u2019t doing a good job. \u201cUgh, I gotta weaken it somehow....Think.....I\u2019ve got it! Wurmple, use String Shot!\u201d Wurmple shot out a sticky web, which bound up Litten. Litten burned the string, and got ready to attack. \u201cNow use a rapid fire String Shot! Tie it to the tree!\u201d \nWurmple began firing webs as fast as it could. Litten could hardly dodge, until two struck it. It began to burn them, but another came, and sent it spinning around a tree branch. Litten was too dizzy to attack. I made my move, and threw my Pokeball. Litten went inside, and it began shaking. Three times it shook, then a click. \nTwo Pokemon! I have two Pokemon now! That\u2019s almost too good. But I didn\u2019t want to stop there. I took Litten out, and I did introductions. \u201cLitten, Wurmple, let\u2019s go find more Pokemon!\u201d I immediately darted towards the lake. I could find at least one water type. Except I didn\u2019t think either of my Pokemon were good at swimming, so I came up with a compromise. \u201cWurmple, make a net out of your String Shot!\u201d Wurmple began spraying, and made a net. \u201cThere we go. Now for bait.\u201d I ran back to the house fast, and grabbed a piece of bread. \u201cLitten, stay back. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d like the water.\u201d Litten was already asleep next to a tree. \nI put the bait in, set the net down, and waited. It felt like forever that we were waiting. I took the time to pet Wurmple. It seemed to enjoy it. Then, the net got a tug. I ran over, and threw up the net with all my strength. A Psyduck was right in the net waiting for me. \u201cWurmple, Poison Sting!\u201d Wurmple shot purple poison spines. Psyduck was hit by a few, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother it. It shot a water gun. I told Wurmple to dodge, and it did. But Litten was still in the way, and it got soaked. Litten stood up, got mad, and pounced onto Psyduck, and started clawing its face off. \n\u201cWoah, that\u2019s some crazy Fury Swipes!\u201d I watched in awe, before Wurmple poked me. \u201cOh! Right!\u201d I took out my Pokeball, and tossed it. Psyduck went inside, and it began shaking. Just like before, three shakes and it was caught. \u201cYes! My third Pokemon is Psyduck!\u201d Wurmple jumped up in celebration, while Litten was shivering. I picked up the poor Pokemon in my arms, and carried it back to my house. \nI got a nice fluffy towel out of the dryer, and helped Litten dry. Litten enjoyed it, and we had a little food in the meantime. The rest of my Pokemon all got acquainted with one another, and I took the time to write their names on the Pokeballs. Seriously, how does anyone tell them apart? \nAfter a little rest, we headed out to find more Pokemon. I headed towards the graveyard, hoping to find a ghost-type, my favorite right next to Poison types. We searched around for a while, but no results. When we headed up to the hill, we saw it. A Gengar, just playing in the graves. My favorite Pokemon. I shook from excitement, and sprinted up to it. \u201cGengar! I have to catch you!\u201d\nI got Litten ready to go, when I heard a voice. \u201cNot so fast!\u201d I turned around and there was a boy behind me. \u201cThat Gengar is mine. I\u2019m going to catch it!\u201d\n\u201cNo way, I was here first!\u201d The boy snickered.\n\u201cHow about we resolve this with a battle? My Pokemon Vs yours? Who ever wins gets Gengar!\u201d He took out a Pokeball. Gengar observed, and seemed to agree with the rules. \nAlright, an actual battle! I got Wurmple ready to go. \u201cSounds good. Let\u2019s go! Wurmple, I choose you!\u201d I sent out Wurmple, and the boy laughed. \n\u201cYou have a Wurmple? Pathetic. Go Rowlet!\u201d He sent out Rowlet. Wurmple was at a disadvantage. I could switch out into Litten, but I wanted to save it for later. \u201cWurmple, Poison Sting!\u201d Wurmple attacked, and Rowlet flew out of the way. \u201cPeck!\u201d Rowlet charged at Wurmple, too fast to dodge. Wurmple flew to the side. \u201cWurmple! Get up and use String Shot!\u201d \nWurmple staggered, but got up, and fired. Rowlet easily cut it up. \u201cAnother Peck!\u201d Rowlet charged again. \u201cHurry and dodge!\u201d Wurmple was too wounded to move, and it got slammed into a tree, and fainted. \u201cWurmple, no!\u201d The boy laughed again. \n\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll be taking Gengar now.\u201d I readied Litten. \u201cNuh Uh! I have two more Pokemon!\u201d He stopped in fear. \u201cY-You do? Which ones?\u201d \n\u201cA Litten and Psyduck.\u201d The boy started getting afraid. \n\u201cUh, you know what, I\u2019ve changed my mind. Bye!\u201d He recalled Rowlet and ran away. \nI was silent, until Gengar walked up. \u201cOh, right. I guess he only had Rowlet. Now then....\u201d\nI\u2019ve had my Pokemon for four months now. And they\u2019ve been so awesome! \nWurmple evolved into Cascoon, then Dustox. It would always fly around happily, and scare away birds. \nLitten evolved into Torracat. She was always very playful, and always napped. She was like the average house cat. I\u2019m still working on how to evolve her into Incineroar. \nPsyduck only recently evolved into Golduck. He always hung around in the lake and played with the fish.\nGengar was just the star of the show. He was always popping into rooms, playing with my family, and doing funny stuff. My little sister especially loved him. \nMy Pokemon made me a huge hit. The news did an interview with me, people would talk to me on the streets, and people at school were jealous. Some people even wanted to do studies on my Pokemon, and I allowed it only if they were very careful. Only a few of them ever really worked out. \nAnd then there was the battles. This cute girl at school had a Machoke and Croconaw, and we would battle, and hang out a lot. A boy had an Arbok and Dugtrio, and we became good friends. And every so often I would meet a new person with Pokemon. Except, the battles would get a little tiring sometimes, because the Pokemon would always be the same. \nBut that\u2019s changing. I\u2019m headed to an official Pokemon League, where people who got Pokemon were invited to fight to become Champion. Trainers from around the world are going, and I\u2019m going to meet a lot of new people. My Pokemon have been training for a while for an event like this, and we\u2019re so psyched that it\u2019s finally happening! \nWish me luck, and I\u2019ll do my best! \nFeedback is appreciated! \n", "Half the city was on fire, and the situation has just moved from horrible to twice as horrible.\nThey watched the dragon for a long time, and saw that there was some sort of  connection with the smaller creature.\nSo they thought that taking down, or capturing, the red one, could stop the orange dragon from destroying the village.\nBut they were wrong, oh how thet were wrong.\nThe brilliant white light vanished as the red beast revealed its new form. The thing just became another Orange dragon, and now the village had to face two of them.\n-Stop, please, stop- said Lucas, he knew that his voice was too low, and not only the creature could not hear him, but there was no chance it could understand.\nBut he was desperate, he always had been the leader of the village since the day the creatures arrived. But it looked like their time was up, as the two dragons, raging as loudly as ever, were about to destroy the village.\nMost of the houses were on fire, some of its inhabitants were dead, and there was nothing he could do. His little friend, the trembling creature, for the first time was not trembling, and was holding the leg of Lucas the same way it usually held on the shining cerulean blanket over his body.\n-Don't be afraid little friend Snorunt- said Lucas. \n-For we have done everything we could for humanity. And this is our final moment, and we can leave with our head held high.\nThe two dragons smelled the fear from everyone, and, as beast do, felt as a menace the only two unafraid creatures. Lucas and his friend.\nSo they slowly approached them, moving the four paws the same way a cat does while approaching his prey.\n-DO IT BEASTS. I KNOW I CAN DO NOTHING. BUT I WILL NOT SCREAM WHEN YOUR FIRE TOUCHES ME.\nThe two dragons got up on their two strongest paws.\nThe little friend, Snorunt, let go Lucas leg, and moved in front of him, then opened up his little arms to protect its friend.\nBut when the flame left the throat of the two dragons, no inhabitant of the village could do anything; and that's why when the two did not die, nobody could understand what happened.\nLucas could see, just for a second, a pink shield in front of him, disappearing as a little sounds, similiar to a meow, came from the sky.\nUp there, above their head, a little pink creature flew above the two dragons.\nThe two dragons seemed terrified, as if that little thing was the biggest threat of their lives. After a few seconds, the dragons flew away.\nAnd a little girl, running, reached the village.\nAnd after her, a giant green bug, a brown bull, an enormous kangaroo, and all sorts of creature approached the village.\n-I'm so sorry- said the girl.\nLucas was confused, but the creature clearly meant no harm, sofelt the urge to hug the little girl\nThe girl hugged him back. And started crying.\n-Thank you- Said Lucas.\n-You don't have to thank me. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It was just a wish... now i have to catch em all...\n", "\"Papa, I'm really sleepy.\"\n\"Sleepy? Alright then. I suppose we'll have to make due here.\" The father looked around the dead forest for a few moments before setting down his rifle and backpack against a nearby tree. His daughter did the same.\n\"Can we build a fire this time papa? I'm so cold.\"\n\"No, I'm afraid not dear. The smoke will lead them to us.\"\n\"Who? The bandits?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Or the monsters?\"\n\"Them too.\" The father took out a lightweight sleeping bag roll from his backpack and handed it to his daughter.\n\"What kind of monsters are around this forest papa?\" The daughter unfurled her sleeping bag across the ground, disrupting the dead leaves and ashes.\n\"I don't know. When they first appeared they all managed to appear in their...natural habitat, I guess you could say. Bugs and plant-based ones probably would have inhabited a forest like this. But when the big ones started to attack and we attacked back, well, that's how we all ended up like this. And now they roam around too, just like us.\"\n\"Do the big ones roam around the world too?\" She was now tucked into her sleeping bag staring at her father with the same blue eyes her mother had.\n\"Some of the ones that survived, yes. At least one of them went into space.\"\n\"One of them went into space?\" The daughter's eyes widened in shock. \"Whoa, how do you know that?\"\n\"I saw it myself.\"\n\"You saw it yourself!?  What did it look like?\"\n\"Well, it was a big, long, green snake flying up in the sky, just beneath the gray clouds.\"\n\"Wow.\" The father began to laugh. \"Papa why are you laughing?\"\n\"I was with your mom when I saw that monster. She said the same thing. 'Wow.' She said the exact same thing.\"\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"A few words that you're too young to be using.\"\n\"What did you do?\"\n\"We were too in shock on what to do. We just froze. Stayed as quiet as can be. It passed by us and kept on going, and then suddenly, about a half mile out, it screamed and rushed up. Sent a shockwave out that nearly destroyed the house we were inside of at the time.\"\n\"Wow. That sounds so crazy. And scary.\"\n\"It was crazy. And it definitely was scary too. When we looked outside where it had been all we saw was the ash that it had kicked up, and a faint light coming from a big hole in those clouds.\"\n\"A hole in the clouds? Did it scare some of the clouds away?\"\nThe father laughed. 'Yes it did. And your mother and I were so curious that we just had to run out and see what was past those clouds.\"\n\"You ran out there? After that crazy monster?\"\n\"We did. We ran as fast as we could to catch a look. To see something that we had never seen before in our lives. Something that our parents and grandparents never saw in their lives.\"\n\"And what did you see?\"\n\"A long tunnel of dark clouds. And at the end was seven sparking stars in the darkness. A darkness unlike any we had ever seen. It was frightening and yet so very, very beautiful.\"\n\"I wish I could have seen that.\"\n\"So do I. Maybe one day you will. But for now, it's time to sleep.\"\n\"Okay papa. Good night.\" The daughter turned over and closed her eyes.\n\"Good night dear.\"\n\"If I ever want to see the stars I might need to meet one of those monsters to scare the clouds away for me though.\"\n\"...I really hope you don't.\" The father stared at his daughter until she fell asleep. He picked up his rifle and hugged it against his chest as he closed his eyes. \"I really hope you don't.\"\n", "When she left, I was brought here on my own journey. Seeking what, I am not sure. If it is a stone, or a mossy rock, or an icy boulder, I will find it \u2014 I will find her. \nShe left me here for a reason. I need to discover how I evolve. \n"]}
