{"When we die we\u2019re reincarnated to another planet. There\u2019s an error and you remember your previous life on earth\n": ["I've always thought since I was a child that maybe we all lived different lives before. Today, all the signs showed itself. I met my wife from my previous life. The moment I met her, I instantly recalled all the experiences that I had in my previous life in a different planet, as a different race. There is a feeling of knowing, that this is real and I couldn't have made all of this up. Perhaps there really is a bond that transcends time and space after all.  \n"]}
