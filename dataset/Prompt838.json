{"The Sphinx has reawakened and will grant the wishes of anyone who can guess the answer to her riddles. The only problem is, she hasn\u2019t accounted for the fact that all the answers are readily available to anyone with a WiFi connection.\n": ["\"Oh no! Not you again.\" \nThe Sphinx. Greatest and most magical creature in all of history rolled its eyes and slumped. The dune under which it had been previously hiding rolled away in a wave as its enormous lions body thundered down, almost completely burying the limited edition 'Desert-Roamer' Sports car Deluxe which shot backwards as the desert shifted against the star strewn night.\n\"Tttthhhe paintwoooooork!\" A small voice shrieked as the car's tracks bit into the dust and spun around. A smartly dressed man jumped out of the hideously expensive car and ran around it in a circle checking every inch. Stopping to polish dusty chromework and untouched paintwork. \n\"Can't you just leave me alone?\" The defeat was clear in the Sphinx's once mighty voice.\nThe man straightened, brushed his perfect suit clean of imaginary dust and turned to face The Sphinx. He pursed his lips and lifted his chin, looking down his nose at the unholy creature. He thought this look gave him power, but really he just looked like a toad caught mid ribbit. \n\"You must be happy with what you've got by now!\" The Sphinx moaned, whipping its despondent tail across the desert sand. \"Money and women. Political influence and global fame. What more do you want?\" \nHe had the creature right where he wanted it. The first time he found it he thought he was dead, but his smartphone had saved him and then his wish made him rich and powerful. \nHis second catching of the creature been more for sport and now he couldn't keep count. Each time he caught it he had grown through the wishes he made. \nIt had become his servent and from time to time, he would remind it of this. \n\"Aren't you going to ask me a question?\" The man pulled back his ratty lips exposing a perfect Hollywood smile. \nThe Sphinx rose up onto its feet and stretched out its wings pawing the ground with its razor sharp talons. It faced the smug little man, threw its head back and laughed. \nIt lifted its giant paw and squashed the man flat.\n\"I already did\" the Sphinx rumbled.\nEdit: thank you so much for the love guys :-)\n", "For decades I've roamed the deserts. For  decades I've lived the life of a nomad, forever restless, forever wandering. Across the yellow dunes and the dust and rubble I've travelled, unencumbered by the yolk of civilization, by the shakles of humanity. I've become an animal. Hunt or be hunted, as my father always told me. Today, I am finally the hunter. Today, I have finally found my prey.\n The tomb has no right to be bright. It has hidden from the light for a millenia, shunned the years of blood and tears, turned its back on the very people who needed it most. But bright it is. As though its golden walls have been drenched in sun. Through an almost ethereal like prism, I see it. The only thing in this cavernous chamber that remains dark. It does not want to be found, but found it has been. It does not want to awake, but awake it shall. \nThe Sphinx. The greatest wonder of this world in which we suffer. A whisper in the wind. A myth, a tale whispered only when the night is at its darkest, when the moon no longer shines, and when the stars have disappeared. \nTo the uneducated mind, it is the least impressive artefact in the room. The most... innocuous, dull. Incongruous, a shadow in contrast to the glittering emeralds and the shining gold with which it has been entombed. I can't help but chuckle as I lay my hand on its rusted surface. \nFor too many years it has bested me. Evaded my every effort to find it. Laughed at my dreams. No longer. \nToday, the Sphinx awakes from her slumber. Today, I shall arise from my prison, stronger than ever. And no one will stand in my way. \nI mumble words forgotten by time, utter verses a mortal could never comprehend. The room fades, as the statue begins to glow, pulsating softly as its power returns. \nAnd now, she stands before me, in all her lethal beauty. But I do not cower. I do not balk from her fearsome gaze. No. I smile. Armed with Wi-Fi, I cannot be defeated. Not again. Never again.\nMy first wish? No more internet. For you, that is. No more \"power to the people.\" No, we shall return to the days of old, you and I. For you, dear mortal, the days of servitude. I have returned, my children...\n(Feedback always appreciated!)\nr/samfoxstories \n", "Some people say that the Great Revelation changed everything, but I know differently. Sure, suddenly all sorts of mythological creatures were running around, magic was revealed to actually exist, and people started being born with superpowers, but humans were, fundamentally, humans. And I know about human nature more than most people, because I\u2019m a history teacher, to high schoolers no less.\nOn the whole, it\u2019s very difficult to get middle schoolers to learn about history, but that\u2019s not the real problem that I\u2019ve been facing recently. No, the problem is that people don\u2019t know how to research properly, even with the use of smartphones. There\u2019s just no motivation for them to dig deeply into a subject. But if students didn\u2019t get taught critical thinking skills at a young age, then they\u2019d get screwed when they were older, a prime target for con artists, Sidhe, or, worse, politicians.\nFortunately, one of the great things about living in a post-Great Revelation world is that it\u2019s a lot harder to believe in impossibilities. And I had been pretty good at thinking outside the box anyway before the world changed. Sure enough, before long, I had come up with an ingenious solution to the problem. It was possibly illegal, most likely immoral, and unquestionably unethical. But it had to be done.\nSome cities had found that they had been sharing space with hibernating dragons or frost giants or werewolves. My town of Eastport, Maine had somehow managed to get its hands on a real, actual sphinx, riddles and all. No one was sure exactly how she managed to end up here, but theories abound, each as ridiculous as the next, and given the nature of our current reality, each one equally likely to be true. \n\u201cIf I drink, I die!\u201d shouted the sphinx as I approached her lair, also known as the only bridge out of the island that Eastport was on. \u201cIf I eat, I am fine! What am I?\u201d \nI pulled out my smartphone and typed the riddle into Google. I got the answer within seconds. \u201cA fire,\u201d I said. The sphinx scowled, but stepped aside. She had gotten increasingly cranky these last few months, because everyone had been able to answer her riddles with the wonders of the Internet. The arcane magical laws that had been interwoven into the sphinxes at the dawn of creation hadn\u2019t accounted for smartphones. \nI didn\u2019t move. \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t come here to access the bridge. I came here to talk to you. I have a proposal for you, one that would be of mutual benefit.\u201d \n\u201cThen speak, mortal,\u201d the sphinx said wearily.\n\u201cYou need better riddles,\u201d I explained, \u201cand I need my students \u2013 as well as the rest of the people in this town \u2013 to develop better researching skills and more knowledge. Sure, they\u2019ll use their smartphones, but it\u2019ll be a challenge for them. I\u2019ll provide you with better riddles, with historical inquiries. In exchange, you have to promise not to kill anyone who fails.\u201d\nThe sphinx scowled at me, but I could tell that she was intrigued. \u201cIf I do not punish travelers, I will wither and die. It is written. I cannot change my nature, any more than you can stop breathing and still live.\u201d\n\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cIf history has taught me one thing, it is always that our nature can be overcome. Naturally good people can become savage monsters; naturally evil people can become noble saints. A sphinx can become more than what was written. You can become more.\u201d \n\u201cHow?\u201d\nI had thought this over very carefully. \u201cIn the old days, when a traveler heard your riddles, they were often carrying nothing more than the clothes on their backs. You had no choice but to deprive them of their lives, because they had nothing valuable otherwise. Today, things are different. People travel by car on this bridge. If they fail, you can confiscate those cars. They can walk instead.\u201d \n\u201cCan I, though?\u201d the sphinx wondered. \u201cWould that not violate mortal law?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you care about mortal law? What do I care about mortal law? Without proper researching skills, without proper critical thinking, the people who create that law will be nothing more than the most audacious hucksters. I don\u2019t want that, and probably neither do you. If they give you the answer within twenty-four hours, you give them back their car. If not, then you can sell it, or crush it, or eat it, or whatever you want.\u201d\nThe sphinx paced back and forth. Her expression was, for lack of a better term, sphinxlike, but I could tell that I was on the verge of hooking her. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\nI smiled at her. \u201cWell, how\u2019s about this for an argument? If you don\u2019t take my deal, if you don\u2019t adapt to the changing times, you will wither away and die.\u201d \nThe sphinx admitted I had a point there, and the deal was struck. \nFrom then on, Eastport became known for having the most incisive, most challenging sphinx this side of Egypt, as well as some of the most well-learned students. The test scores in my class soared and the critical thinking skills that they learned from their many run-ins with the sphinx helped make sure that the standardized test scores went up correspondingly. I frequently saw townspeople perusing the history books in the library. The sphinx, out of gratitude for my help, let me out of the town without having to answer any questions, but I answered them anyway because it was fair.\nIt took a while, but it was finally discovered that I was the one who was feeding the sphinx her new riddles. I think the fact that I accidentally used one of the riddles as a final exam question two days *before* the sphinx used it was the smoking gun, but people had been suspecting me for a while. \nI was worried that I was going to get into legal trouble, but the city council decided not to throw the book at me in the end. I was the sphinx\u2019s silent partner, and the sphinx had put Eastport on the map, literally in a few cases. Without me, the tourism revenue that they had gotten from people journeying here from far away to see the Sphinx of Eastport was gone.\nBut, honestly, teaching is getting kind of boring. I\u2019ve more or less accomplished everything that I sought to achieve. I think I\u2019ll go in a different field. Counselor to magical creatures sounds like fun. After all, I think I did a good job with my first try.\n", "To see a new name on the world's billionaire list is rare, but it happens, to see a new name in the top ten, that is unheard of. Now, a new name appearing in the number one spot, impossible. Every day, for the last four days, there has been a new face on Forbe's number one spot. \nSpecial Agent Knox, sat in economy class on his flight from Washington to Cairo, a total journey of seventeen hours, with a layover in Dubai. An FBI badge glued to his head would be less obvious than his suit, clean-shaven face and his crew cut. He slept, he tried to work, he watched a couple of movies, but nothing seemed to distract from the interview he had conducted two days prior. He read the unclassified transcript of his interview with Steve Burman, a forty-one-year-old, who had been the first new multi-billionaire. Steve had been courteous; he was not the sharpest tool in the box, but he lawyered up faster than Knox could make coffee. \nKnox interview two other new faces, a thirty-year-old woman, Lisa Hudson,  followed Steve's lawyer approach and before the FBI knew it the two of them were walking out arms wrapped around the best lawyers money could buy. The last new face had been an eighteen-year-old, Brent Alderwood, he was sunburnt beyond belief, his face still wore badges of adolescence, and he was scared. Brent, at the time, was currently the wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of over one-hundred and fifty billion dollars. He caved before Knox even sat down. He erupted into a fit of verbal diarrhoea, which led to Knox's trip to Egypt. \nKnox met Special Agent Phillips at the Cairo arrivals gate, Phillips had been sent out two days before Knox, having found that the first two new billionaires had both returned from Egypt. \n'How was your flight?' \nPhillips extended a paw-like hand towards Knox, who shook it. \n'Long.' \n'Do you have it?' Phillips' eyes were glittering. \nThey left the airconditioned airport to humidity that stuck in Knox's throat. \n'Yes, I have it.' Knox said while he swallowed, what felt like, molten air. \nThe hotel was modest, above average for an overseas expedition. Knox crashed within five minutes of reaching his room, a combination of the ten hours time difference and recycled aeroplane air made for the perfect nightcap. \nThe sun woke Knox; he rolled out of bed and nearly accused the clock of lying. Ten. With tender fingers, he checked his phone for notifications. Fifteen missed calls. Shit. Adding to his problems, the brown envelope he had carefully transported from Washington to Cairo was missing from his jacket pocket. The envelope held the classified transcript of the Brent Alderwood interview, which details the location of the Sphinx.\nKnox rapped on Phillip's door, greeted by cold silence. Knox then tried to call him, answer phone.  Knox caught a cab to the Sphinx, located between two of the significant tourist pyramids; it was a gigantic cordoned off sand coloured statue. Up-close, it appeared to be moving, ever so slightly, like it was breathing. There was no sign of Phillips, but Knox drew level with the Sphinx's human head, its mouth lumbered open and forced Knox to recoil. \n'Answer my riddle, and you will be granted one wish.' It spoke in an archaic language that somehow, Knox still understood. \nHe had read the classified interview hundreds of times, Brent had spoken on a wish giving Sphinx, he had wished to be the wealthiest person alive. It was understood as a codename, not an actual Sphinx. The FBI believed it to be an Egyptian hacker who, under the name of Sphinx. \n'I uh, I can't' Knox said. \nThe Sphinx tilted its head; its eyes seemed to look straight through him. \n'What's the matter? Your friend was keen to answer.' \n'He was?' Knox didn't want to mention that Phillips was in no way his friend. \n'One simple riddle. Anything can be yours.' \nThe low paying job, the promise of riches and the allure of this ancient Sphinx was sending Knox into a trance.\n'What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, three legs in the evening, and no legs at night?' \nKnox used his phone as many others had, but he had not wished for wealth. That was stupid, he wished for something far greater.\n"]}
